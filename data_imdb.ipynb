In 1973, U.S. government agent Bill Randa hires former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad, a skilled tracker, to guide an expedition to map out a recently discovered island known as Skull Island. They are escorted by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard and his subordinates. The group is joined by anti-war photographer Mason Weaver, who believes that the expedition is a secret military operation, and intends to expose it..</div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">In the year 1944, somewhere over the South Pacific, Lieutenant Hank Marlow (Will Brittain) lands with his parachute on an island after his plane crashes. Another soldier, Gunpei Ikari (Miyavi), lands. Marlow draws his gun on Ikari and shoots but misses. Ikari takes out his gun and chases after Marlow. They run into the forest and fight when they go by a cliff. Ikari nearly impales Marlow with his sword, but Marlow pulls it away. Ikari then has Marlow on the ground and nearly kills him before a gigantic ape hand appears. The two men then see the ape (Terry Notary) rise above them.<br/><br/>In 1973, in Washington D.C., government official Bill Randa (John Goodman) and geologist Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) arrive to meet with Senator Willis (Richard Jenkins) to receive funding for an expedition to a recently discovered location called Skull Island. Willis isn\\'t too keen on the idea, but Randa goads him into relenting. Before leaving, Randa tells Willis he also would like a military escort.<br/><br/>The Sky Devils squadron are gathered on their last day before they can finally go home. Led by Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), they include Captain Earl Cole (Shea Whigham), Slivko (Thomas Mann), Reles (Eugene Cordero), Glenn Mills (Jason Mitchell), and Jack Chapman (Toby Kebell), who is Packard\\'s right hand man. Packard receives the call for the expedition and gladly accepts the job.<br/><br/>Randa and Brooks go to a bar and find a former British Special Air Service captain named James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) to be their tracker. Conrad is confronted by two bar patrons who believe he cheated in a game of pool, but he easily subdues the men. Randa is immediately impressed, telling Brooks they\\'ve found their guide. Conrad sits with Randa and Brooks to hear their plan. When he hears their offer, he demands more money and points out that there\\'s a good chance that the trip will get them killed for reasons involving severe weather conditions or predatory creatures.<br/><br/>Inside a darkroom, anti-war photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) is developing some photos she took of the conflict in Vietnam. She gets a call to join the expedition and she arrives at the base to meet with Packard and his men, plus a team of scientists from the company Landsat, including Brooks\\' fellow geologist San Lin (Jing Tian) and Landsat employees Victor Nieves (John Ortiz) and Steve (Marc Evan Jackson). Weaver has reservations about the mission and thinks the military is planning something bad. Brooks goes over the mission and what they hope to find on Skull Island.<br/><br/>The team sails into the ocean before taking choppers to the island. They must pass through clouds that produce hurricane-like conditions but are able to find a high-pressure pocket that they believe will be a safer route. After a turbulent ride through the storm, the choppers fly across the area. Weaver takes some pictures while the soldiers begin dropping seismic charges into the ground, setting off explosions. Almost immediately, a tree is thrown through one of the choppers, sending it crashing to the ground. The team then sees Kong towering over them. He sends another tree through a chopper before grabbing a few more and smashing them into the ground. The surviving team members are separated once they hit the ground. Amidst the flames burning from the remains of the choppers, Packard stares up at Kong, who looks down back at him.<br/><br/>Packard confronts Randa at gunpoint and demands to know what really brought them there. Randa admits that he had known about the existence of monsters like Kong for a while, and he is seeking proof for his organization, Monarch.<br/><br/>Conrad, Weaver, Brooks, Lin, Slivko, and Nieves are grouped together while Randa, Packard, Mills, Cole, and other soldiers set out to look for Chapman, as he is equipped with enough ammunition that Packard intends to use against Kong. As the soldiers walk through a bamboo forest forest, one soldier suddenly stops, a bamboo tree has impaled him through the mouth. Above them is a giant spider that starts attacking them. Mills is pulled up by the webbing, and the rest of the soldiers start cutting its legs off. Mills cuts himself loose, and Packard shoots the spider to death.<br/><br/>Chapman is by himself near a river. He sees Kong walking through the river to tend to a wound he sustained from the choppers\\' gunfire. Kong drinks from the river and then finds a giant octopus. He tangles with it, fighting off its tentacles before he starts to eat it. He then drags the octopus carcass away.<br/><br/>Conrad\\'s group is cornered by a tribe of natives. As they try to defend themselves, out comes an older Marlow (now played by John C. Reilly). He assures both groups that they are not harmful to each other and then invites the group past the wall. Marlow explains to the group that he\\'s been there for the last 28 years and has learned a lot about the natives and the island itself. Kong is like a god to them, as he has been protecting them from the creatures that dwell beneath the earth and have been killing off the natives for centuries, as well as Kong\\'s own family. Marlow calls them \"Skull Crawlers\". They stayed underground until the explosions from the seismic charges woke them up. If anything happens to Kong, the Skull Crawlers will dominate the island. He also suggests that the Skull Crawlers that have come to the surface are just juveniles and that a much larger one exists.<br/><br/>Still alone, Chapman walks through the forest and sits on a log. The log turns out to be a giant insect. Chapman shoots at it, but the creature does not retaliate. As the creature leaves, Chapman is killed by a Skull Crawler.<br/><br/>Conrad tells Marlow that they plan to make it to their rendezvous point on the north side of the island within three days so that they may be rescued. Marlow says that it cannot be done in three days on foot, so he agrees to guide them the right way. He bids the natives farewell and takes the crew on a boat. Shortly after riding away, Nieves is snatched up by carnivorous birds and is torn apart midair.<br/><br/>Along the way, Weaver sees a huge water buffalo stuck under a crashed chopper. She tries lifting it up to free the buffalo, only for Kong to show up and pull the chopper off. He stares down at Weaver briefly and leaves. She appears more awed by him than terrified.<br/><br/>Marlow leads the group into The Forbidden Zone, which is a former battleground between Kong\\'s ancestors and the Skull Crawlers. The enormous remains of Kong\\'s family lie among the field. A Skull Crawler appears, forcing the group to hide. The Skull Crawler then spits out Chapman\\'s skull and dog tags, which Conrad notices. Packard and his men come around the same area. Randa is taking pictures and is then snatched up and eaten by a Skull Crawler. Another beast shows up and starts to attack and pull victims in with its tongue. The groups continue their battle with the Skull Crawlers plus a wave of the carnivorous birds. Marlow takes out the sword that belonged to Ikari and slashes through several of the birds before handing it over to Conrad. Weaver kills one by tossing a lighter into a hole that produces fumes, which is ignited and sets the creature on fire.<br/><br/>After the fight, they regroup. Packard is still set on looking for Chapman. Conrad shows Packard Chapman\\'s dog tags to confirm his demise. Still, Packard wants to look for Chapman\\'s ammunition stash so that they can kill Kong; he is hellbent on revenge for the deaths of his men, despite the objections of Marlow, Conrad, and Weaver.<br/><br/>That night, Packard gathers explosives and lays a trap for Kong. Meanwhile, Conrad and Weaver encounter the beast, but Weaver approaches him cautiously. She places her hand on his face and he is gentle. However, Packard lures Kong toward him and ignites the fuel along the water, singeing and burning Kong\\'s fur. Kong stomps on Steve and kills another man in the chaos before collapsing. Packard then gets ready to set off some explosives, but Conrad and Weaver try to stop him. They convince the other soldiers that they need Kong to keep the Skull Crawlers out. The soldiers turn on Packard, who remains defiant. Just then, the biggest Skull Crawler bursts out of the ground, forcing the group to run. Packard stays behind to detonate the explosives, but Kong crushes him under his fist.<br/><br/>The survivors then head toward the shore as the main Skull Crawler pursues them. Cole stays behind to sacrifice himself with the explosive devices he has strapped to himself. However, the monster tail-whips Cole into a wall and he blows up anyway. The Skull Crawler heads toward the group until Kong returns and smashes into the beast. Kong uses a ship\\'s propeller attached to a length of anchor chain to would the beast, finally slashing it on the throat. The best isn\\'t dead and attacks again. Weaver takes a flare gun and hits the Skull Crawler in the face with it. Kong grabs the Skull Crawler and hurls him into the wall, accidentally knocking Weaver into the river. Kong pulls Weaver out and still fights the Skull Crawler. He rams his fist down the monster\\'s throat and pulls out its guts. Kong then places Weaver down next to Conrad before leaving.<br/><br/>Shortly after, the survivors (Conrad, Weaver, Marlow, Brooks, Lin, Mills, Slivko, and Reles) depart on the boat, and three choppers show up to get them. In the distance, Kong keeps a lookout to continue protecting his territory. He pounds his fist and lets out a roar.<br/><br/>As the credits begin, we see video footage of Marlow finally returning home to Chicago where he sees his wife again and finally meets his adult son. He then sits down to watch a Cubs game with a hot dog and a beer.<br/><br/>After the credits, Conrad and Weaver are being held in an interrogation room by Monarch. Entering the room are Brooks and Lin, who tell the two that Kong was never the only monster out there and that this world did not always belong to humankind. Brooks pulls out some files, including a map of Tokyo, before putting on a slideshow. The slides show another crew coming across cave drawings of other monsters - Mothra, King Ghidorah, Rodan and Godzilla himself. The last thing we hear are the combined roars of Kong and Godzilla.</div></div>'}\n",

Adrian travels to Washington DC and gives a report on the findings to White House Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) who takes Adrian to meet the President of the United States. In 2010, President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover) and other international leaders begin a secret project to ensure humanity\\'s survival. Approximately 400,000 people are chosen to board ships that are being constructed at Cho Ming, Tibet, in the Himalayas. At the same time as the People\\'s Liberation Army are gathering volunteers, a Buddhist monk named Nima (Osric Chau) is evacuated while his brother Tenzin (Chin Han) joins the workers in the ship project. Additional funding for the project is raised by selling tickets to the private sector for one billion euros per person. By 2011, humanity\\'s valuable treasures are moved to the Himalayas under the guise of protecting them from terrorist attacks with the help of art expert and First Daughter Dr. Laura Wilson (Thandie Newton). One of the artworks is the Mona Lisa, which is replaced in the Louvre with a precise copy. Her boss, Roland Picard (Patrick Bauchau) is later killed when his car is forced into a fatal auto accident in the same Paris underpass where Princess Diana was killed. Picard had discovered that the cave containing the vault where the Mona Lisa &amp; other precious works of art were supposed to be stored was a fake location.<br/><br/>In 2012, Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is a science fiction writer in Los Angeles who works part-time as a limousine driver for the Russian oligarch billionaire, Yuri Karpov (Zlatko Buri). Jackson\\'s ex-wife, Kate (Amanda Peet) and their children Noah (Liam James) and Lilly (Morgan Lily) live with Kate\\'s boyfriend, plastic surgeon Gordon Silberman (Thomas McCarthy). Jackson takes Noah and Lilly camping in Yellowstone National Park. After an encounter at a restricted government research site with Helmsley, they meet Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson), who hosts a radio show from the park. Charlie, a conspiracy theorist, plays a video of Charles Hapgood\\'s theory that polar shifts and the Mesoamerican Long Count Calendar predict that the 2012 phenomenon will occur. Hapgood believed that unstable conditions under the crust of the Earth would cause it to shift -- Earth crust displacement. Charlie has a map of the ark project in addition to conspiracy-theory information about officials and scientists from around the world who were murdered after planning to alert the public. One such scientist was a fan of Charlie\\'s &amp; had sent him the map before his untimely death. The family returns home as seismic activity vastly increases along the west coast of the United States. After dropping off Karpov\\'s bratty sons at the airport, Jackson grows suspicious and rents a plane to rescue his family. He collects his family and Gordon as the Earth crust displacement begins, and they narrowly escape Los Angeles as the city slips into the Pacific Ocean, racked by a massive earthquake that destroys all of downtown. As millions die in catastrophic earthquakes worldwide, the group, with Gordon piloting the small plane, flies to Yellowstone to retrieve Charlie\\'s map, escaping as the Yellowstone Caldera erupts. Charlie stays behind to broadcast the eruption and is killed in the blast of the expulsion of an ash cloud. Learning that the ships are in China, the group lands in a devastated Las Vegas to find a larger plane.<br/><br/>They meet Yuri, his twin sons Alec and Oleg (played by Alexandre and Philippe Haussmann), girlfriend Tamara (Beatrice Rosen) and pilot Sasha (Johann Urb). The group secures an Antonov An-225 aircraft (erroneously and perhaps deliberately marked an \"Antonov 500\") and they depart for China. Also heading for the Cho Ming site aboard Air Force One are Anheuser, Helmsley and Laura Wilson. Upon arriving in Tibet, they find that the ships are not ships destined to take the survivors off Earth but are giant seagoing ships, large arks that can hold thousands of people. Helmsley finds that the cabins are actually quite luxurious and only meant for 1-2 people, a fact he criticizes when he tells his porter the room could hold about 10 people. Anheuser explains that the high price of a room was necessary to fund the project since the governments of the world couldn\\'t possibly have hidden the cost for very long.<br/><br/>President Wilson remains in Washington, D.C. to address the nation one last time. With the Vice President dead and the Speaker of the House missing, Anheuser assumes de facto leadership. Washington is hit by the pyroclastic ejecta cloud from Yellowstone, which covers the city in a choking cloud of thick ash. Struggling with others in the devastation, President Wilson is killed by a megatsunami which carries the aircraft carrier John F Kennedy into the White House, crushing it.<br/><br/>Sasha and the group plan to land briefly at Hawaii to refuel, however, the island chain has been devastated by volcanic activity. Continuing on, Sasha fears they may run out of fuel before making it to mainland Asia. They discover that the seismic activity of the Earth\\'s surface has shifted the Chinese coast 1500 miles east and they are able to make a crash landing, narrowly escaping death by driving a Bentley out of the plane before it skids to a stop on a glacier. The plane overbalances on the edge of a cliff and plummets, taking Sasha with it. The group is spotted by the People\\'s Liberation Army. Yuri and his sons, possessing tickets, are taken to the arks, Yuri coldly leaving Tamara (whose affair with Sasha was something he knew of) and the others behind.<br/><br/>They remaining survivors are picked up by Nima and are taken to the arks with his grandparents (Lisa Lu and Chang Tseng). They stow away on the ark with the help of Tenzin, who had a plan to smuggle his family aboard through a rear entrance. As a megatsunami approaches the site, an impact driver becomes lodged between the gears of the ark\\'s hydraulics chamber, preventing a boarding gate from closing and rendering the ship unable to start its engines. In the ensuing chaos, Yuri, Gordon and Tamara are killed, Tenzin is wounded, and the ark is set adrift. Just before he dies, Yuri is able hoist both his sons up to crew members of the ship; in doing so, he jumps to his death. Jackson and Noah dislodge the impact driver and the crew regains control of the ark before it can impact Mount Everest. After flood waters from the tsunamis recede, the arks travel to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa where the Drakensberg Mountains have risen in relation to sea level and become the tallest mountain range on Earth.</div></div>'}\n",

In the years since, Ikaris would abandon Sersi as the other Eternals await their return to Olympia.<br/><br/>In the present day, Sprite lives with Sersi in London as she works as a museum curator with a romantic interest in her colleague Dane Whitman. One night, Sersi, Sprite and Whitman are leaving a party when they are attacked by a Deviant. They are joined by Ikaris as they fight to eradicate the beast, but they discover that it is able to heal itself. As Whitman is left behind, Sersi, Sprite and Ikaris decide to leave for South Dakota in search of Ajak. At her house, they find her body instead, a victim of an earlier Deviant attack. As Sersi mourns over the cadaver of their leader, Ajak passes on the sphere she uses to communicate with Arishem to her. With the Deviant threat looming, the three decide to venture out to find the other Eternals.<br/><br/>They approach Kingo as he shoots a new Bollywood film, who is hesitant to leave his life of stardom and rejoin the Eternals. He gives in when he learns about Ajak, alongside additional encouragement from his valet Karun Patel, who also tags alongside them to film a documentary for Kingo. The group locates Gilgamesh and Thena in Australia as the latter\\'s Wy\\'ry resurfaces due to a recent Deviant attack. After examining Thena\\'s artwork she had painted during her episodes of Wy\\'ry, which visualized memories of planetary destructions in the past, Sersi uses the sphere to successfully establish a connection to Arishem. The Prime Celestial reveals to Sersi that Olympia does not actually exist- instead, he had engineered the Eternals in the World Forge. He had also created the Deviants to eradicate Earth\\'s apex predators and allow intelligent life to thrive, but a critical design flaw led them to evolve and become predators themselves.<br/><br/>So, the Eternals were deployed onto Earth to protect the humans, unaware that they were also defending a seed that would spawn the new Celestial Tiamut the Communicator once the population quota of intelligent life was achieved. When that happens, the Emergence would commence, resulting in the destruction of the planet and the birth of said Celestial, which would allow for new life and galaxies to form. Afterwards, the memories of the Eternals would be taken from them and studied by Arishem to make way for their next planetary mission. Appalled with the true meaning of their existence, Sersi informs the others. Together, they realize that Thena\\'s mental affliction was the result of a botched memory wipe after a previous Emergence.<br/><br/>Hoping to delay the Emergence, they find Druig in an Amazon village in hopes that he could be able utilize his telepathy to render Tiamut the Communicator dormant, but he is hesitant to help them. At night, they are ambushed by the Deviants and fight to fend them off. Ikaris and Sersi are viciously attacked by one of the beasts, but she uses her powers to transmute it into a tree, to everyone\\'s surprise. As Thena begins to fall insane yet again, Gilgamesh rushes to her side. However, this allows the Deviant leader Kro to attack him and absorb his powers, gaining a humanoid figure, intelligible speech, and his memories.<br/><br/>Before fleeing, Kro pledges to kill the Eternals for their actions towards the Deviants. With his last words, Gilgamesh successfully gets Thena to remember who she is, curing her of the affliction. The rest of the Eternals mourn the loss of their strongest fighter with a cremation, with Thena scattering his ashes in the river. Druig proclaims that he is not powerful enough to affect a Celestial, so they head to Chicago to seek out Phastos, who had long abandoned mankind and his technological ambitions after his technology was used to create the atomic bomb. However, he has newfound hope for humanity after finding a new life with his husband Ben Stoss and son Jack Stoss. He initially refuses to leave his family, but relents after Ben convinces him to fight for Jack\\'s future.<br/><br/>Heading to Iraq, they retrieve the Domo from an archaeological site and find Makkari residing in the ship. As they all are imbued with infinite cosmic energy, Phastos proposes they channel their energy into Druig and form a Uni-Mind so that he can take control of the Celestial and stop the Emergence. But not everyone is onboard with the plan, with Ikaris being the primary dissident. When Kingo pledges to remain alongside Ikaris up until the end, he recalls his last encounter with Ajak six days prior. She informs Ikaris that although the Blip brought the Emergence closer to reality, the heroics of the Avengers inspired her to doubt Arishem for the first time. But as he remains a firm believer in Arishem, Ikaris takes Ajak to a town in Alaska, where the Deviants trapped in ice were resurfacing due to global warming associated with the Emergence. He pushes her into the path of Kro, who absorbs her life force and gains her hyper-regenerative powers. Ikaris takes Ajak\\'s body back home before breaking down over what he had done.<br/><br/>Sersi senses the commencement of the Emergence, prompting Phastos to send Makkari out and find Tiamut, who is at a volcanic island in the Indian Ocean. Druig deduces Ikaris\\' role in Ajak\\'s death, and Sersi learns he was made aware of their true mission by Ajak centuries ago. Ikaris argues that it is their duty as Eternals to protect the Celestial cycle of life so that the universe may continue to exist. When Kingo threatens to attack Ikaris, Sprite decides to leave with him. As he does not want to face Arishem but wishes not to fight his friends, Kingo also departs along with Karun. Thena convinces Sersi to continue Ajak\\'s mission as her successor and prevent the Emergence from eliminating all of mankind. To facilitate the Uni-Mind, Phastos takes Sersi\\'s communication sphere and disassembles it to construct bracelets for the other Eternals to wear.<br/><br/>At the island, Sersi, Thena and Makkari lend their energy to Druig and allow him to connect with Tiamut, but Ikaris blasts him into a hole and destroys the Domo. Determining that Sersi\\'s matter transmutation powers are their last chance to stop the Emergence, Makkari, Thena and Phastos confront Ikaris to give her cover. Kro attacks the Eternals and nearly kills Makkari, but Phastos knocks him into a cave where Thena follows him into. Sprite projects an illusion of Ajak to distract Sersi before stabbing her with a dagger. As she is constantly mocked for her childlike stature, Sprite envies Sersi for being able to live a full life among humans, hoping that the Emergence\\'s aftermath would allow her to be reborn as a full-sized lifeform. Druig recovers and knocks Sprite out, but he is unable to utilize his powers against Tiamut again, forcing Sersi to face it alone as the Celestial begins to rise from Earth\\'s crust.<br/><br/>Kro impersonates Gilgamesh and attempts to take over Thena\\'s mind, but she is able to resist him and kills the Deviant. Phastos manages to restrain Ikaris and prevent him from using his powers momentarily, but he eventually breaks free and flies away to stop Sersi. However, he is emotionally unable to bring himself to harm her. Remembering their time on Earth and the love they shared, he surrenders. Despite this, Sersi still doesn\\'t have enough energy to kill Tiamut, however, suddenly something unites all the Eternals - including Ikaris and Sprite - into the Uni-Mind, attaining enough energy to allow Sersi to transform Tiamut\\'s body into marble. Guilt-ridden, Ikaris apologizes to Sersi before fleeing Earth, flying directly into the Sun. Phastos deduces that it was Tiamut itself that initiated the Uni-Mind - this was always the way for Eternals to survive destructions of planets, but this time it resulted in the Celestial\\'s death. Having retained some energy from the Uni-Mind, Sersi fulfills Sprite\\'s wishes and transmutes her into a human to allow her to grow up.<br/><br/>Two weeks later in South Dakota, Thena, Makkari and Druig depart for space on the Domo, which had been repaired by Phastos, in search for more Eternals and tell them the truth. Back in London, Sprite bids goodbye to Sersi as she moves out with Kingo to attend school. Sersi is out on another date with Whitman when Arishem dramatically appears outside Earth\\'s orbit. For sabotaging Tiamut\\'s emergence, he abducts Sersi, Phastos and Kingo to evaluate their memories for a final judgement of the humans, sparing them for now.<br/><br/>Mid-credit scene: Thena, Makkari and Druig are visited by the Eternal Eros (brother of Thanos) and his assistant Pip the Troll, who offer they\\'re partnership.<br/><br/>Post-credit scene: Dane Whitman opens an old chest inherited from his ancestors that contains the legendary Ebony Blade when an unseen person questions him whether he his ready for it.</div></div>'}\n",

In the store we see rocket space toys. The shop keeper is watching the news, where an extraordinary bomb in China is being reported. Lee then walks through the street to a park where his wife, Evelyn (Emily Blunt), is pushing youngest son Beau on a swing. The Abbott family are there to watch a baseball game in which eldest son Marcus is playing. Lee sits next to Regan (his eldest child, and only daughter, who is deaf) on the stalls and says hi to his friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy), who is sat behind them with his youngest son. Emmett\\'s eldest son bats the ball and makes a home run. As he runs to the final base the crowd and Emmett are shouting \\'dive!\\' as the fielders are close. After this Emmett asks Regan how to say \\'Dive\\' and she signals a diving motion with her hands in American Sign Language. Beau and Evelyn wish Marcus good luck as he goes up to bat. Marcus misses the first two balls, then is distracted by a large meteor in the sky. The game stops and everyone starts heading back to their cars / homes. Regan goes with her dad and Evelyn takes the boys. The aliens are already here though and start attacking the street and killing lots of people.<br/><br/>\\nDay 474<br/><br/>The film cuts to moments after the events of A Quiet Place 1, the Abbott family leaves their home barefoot. (By this point, day 472-473, Evelyn has given birth to a baby boy, Lee was killed protecting Marcus and Regan from an alien, the house is both on fire and flooding and Evelyn has just killed several aliens with the help of Regan\\'s cochlea implant feedback noise amplified by a speaker which weakens the aliens. Beau died on day 89 due to taking a space rocket toy from the store at the beginning of a Quiet Place 1, the sound of the toy attracted an alien who quickly attacked).<br/><br/>Just before leaving the farm, Evelyn tells Marcus and Regan to \\'stay there\\' whist she quietly heads back into the flooded cellar and tries to stay quiet as she swims in search of an oxygen tank. Meanwhile Regan tells Marcus she\\'s going back to the house, and leaves Marcus with the baby. Regan collects the amplifier and microphone. She uses her clipper to cut a cord off the amplifier. Regan and Evelyn individually return and the family walk along the sandy path Lee had created until they reach the furthest point, and then they quietly step onto the dry leaves and continue their trek. Evelyn and Regan carry the baby in a trunk sound proofed with blankets and the oxygen tank is feeding a baby respiratory mask so that the trunk lid can be closed.<br/><br/>The family reach a wire fence with an opening. As Evelyn walks through, her bag gets caught and a small sound is made, she looks behind her concerned about the noise and unknowingly triggers a trip wire that causes a bundle of bottles to fall and jangle. Evelyn whispers to Marcus and Regan \"RUN\". Meanwhile we cut perspective to a the view point through a gun aim that has been fixed on the family. An alien starts chasing the family.<br/><br/>Whilst running, Marcus gets injured by a bear trap, which he handles silently until he sees his injured foot and lets out a primal scream. Evelyn tries to stop him screaming whilst Regan uses the amp, microphone and cochlear implant hearing aid to to create feedback that is unbearable to the alien. Evelyn shoots the alien in the head as it struggles against the sound.<br/><br/>The family head inside a nearby derelict building. As they walk round a corner a man grabs Evelyn, puts his hand over Evelyn\\'s mouth and signals shh while pointing to an alien on the ceiling. The man leads the family to a sound proof vault underground. A towel over the latch of the vault reduces noise and prevents the latch locking the door from the inside. He starts a timer on a stop watch and after a few minutes opens the door to let in air.<br/><br/>Once safe, he tells the family they can\\'t stay - there isn\\'t enough food or water. Evelyn thinks she recognizes the man and says, \\'Emmett?\\' - to which Emmett unmasks his face from the scarf and baseball cap he\\'d been wearing. He reiterates they can\\'t stay. Evelyn asks about Emmett\\'s children and he explains his sons died on Day 1.<br/><br/>Evelyn asks after Lola, his wife. He explains Lola died 11 weeks ago, that she got sick and they moved down to the sound proof basement of this derelict warehouse once the pain was too bad and she was screaming. Emmett says \\'I couldn\\'t do enough\\'.<br/><br/>Evelyn asks if Emmett would see the fires lit by Lee each night and if \\'he knew it was him [Lee]?\\'. Emmett says he did. Evelyn asks why didn\\'t he didn\\'t come for them, since they were friends. (In A Quiet Place 1 the Abbot family had not had any contact from anyone and heard no radio signals despite searching and searching, very few survivors were left on Earth). Emmett explains that the people left, \\'you don\\'t know, do you? ...they\\'re not people worth saving\\'. Regan signs and whispers \\'you\\'re nothing like him [Lee]!\\' to Emmett.<br/><br/>Regan goes to her brother who is lying down to rest having had his ankle painfully dressed (in the vault to mute his screams). Regan gives Marcus headphones and plays radio white noise to him, scrolling through the frequencies. Suddenly Marcus hears music and sits bolt upright. Regan stops turning the dial and Evelyn rushes over. Marcus whispers \\'music!\\' and Evelyn listens. Shocked she turns to Emmet who explains yes it\\'s just the song \\'Across The Sea\\' on a loop, that\\'s all it ever does. Regan signs that he is a liar telling her mum that \\'Dad would have heard it, he would have told us\\'. Emmett explains that you can\\'t hear that signal down in the valley (where the Abbotts lived) - he and Lola only discovered it when they moved up here.<br/><br/>Regan works out the signal originates from an island nearby, about 1 day\\'s walk away. In the middle of the night she wakes Marcus and they go to the sound proof vault to talk. Regan attempts to convince Marcus to help her find a way to the radio tower, by following railway tracks to the coast then finding a boat. She wants to get to the station so that she can use the station to transmit the high frequency noise her hearing aid produces, that exposes weak spots on the aliens. In this way anyone (including the family) can use a radio to play the high pitch noise and protect themselves from the aliens - a significant step towards a better way of life. Marcus is very worried and does not want Regan to go. Regan insists she has to try because that\\'s what Dad would have done. Regan is forced to venture out on her own very early in the morning after Marcus threatens to tell Mum (Evelyn). She leaves a note on the radio saying \\'keep listening\\'.<br/><br/>In the morning, after discovering that Regan has gone, Evelyn pleas Emmett to go after her and bring her back. He eventually agrees when Evelyn says that she wishes Lee was here to look him in the eye and tell him Regan is exactly the type of person worth saving.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Regan comes across a train station with a derailed train and climbs aboard the front carriage, which is the only one still on the train track. There are several dead bodies, skeletons. She needs a first aid kit and finds one in the driver booth but struggles to open the door. She eventually reaches the box and takes it but the skeleton of the dead driver falls on her causing a fright and she screams. An alien shortly arrives and Regan is trapped struggling to hold the hearing aid to the microphone in one hand and operate the shotgun in the other. Luckily Emmett arrives and shoots the creature.<br/><br/>They hide in near by station office due to fear the noise will have attracted more aliens. Emmett explains he is here to take her home. Regan is not happy and says \\'what \"home\"\\'. Regan explains her plan to Emmett, and says that before when his wife died there wasn\\'t anything he could do but now there is. Emmett decides to help her complete the mission.<br/><br/>Back at Emmett\\'s base, Evelyn has to leave Marcus and the baby to get supplies they require - medicine for Marcus\\' foot and more oxygen tanks for the baby for when the baby is in the trunk. Marcus is very scared and doesn\\'t want her to go. Evelyn explains his foot will get worse and she can\\'t lose him too. Marcus understands and let\\'s her go.<br/><br/>She walks back to the sand path and follows the route she and the family uses to get to the store (where Lee bought oranges on Day 1). Along the way she passes the bridge where Beau died where a make-shift shrine is. She touched the photographs crying, and places her wedding ring on top of the cross.<br/><br/>Back at base, after getting the baby to sleep, Marcus exits the bunker and explores the compound. The camera cuts to the baby\\'s oxygen tank the gauge for which is in the red zone, since its is running low. Heading upstairs, Marcus finds a room covered in drawings of Emmett\\'s sons. Behind some curtains separating a section of the room he finds a dead body half composed (probably Lola) lying in a bed. This startles him and he accidentally knocks a few objects over, alerting a nearby alien to his location.<br/><br/>He runs back to the basement, grabs the baby and puts him in the vault, he then steps out again to grab the stopwatch and radio and, as the alien approaches, he is able to get into the vault and close the door. The towel is not over the latch and the door locks shut unbeknownst to Marcus.<br/><br/>By nightfall Emmett and Regan reach some docks and look for a boat they can take to reach the island. They find a little girl at the end of the pontoon. Emmett goes up to her and she suddenly traps him in a noose. Several feral people appear who tie netting with bottles around Emmett and begin to search Regan for supplies. They take her hearing aid and rucksack full of supplies, then begin to lead her away. Emmett signs \\'dive\\' to Regan, then he wriggles opens the netting making lots of noise and grabs the man who took Regan\\'s hearing aid. Several aliens appear and attack the docks, killing a number of feral people. Emmett is still holding the man and an alien comes to attack due to the noise of the bottles. Emmett dives into the water and the feral man is killed by the alien. The alien then hears Emmett swimming in the water, and jumps after him, only to drown as it cannot swim. Emmett is still tied to the dock and struggles to remove the noose from his neck. A small boat comes by and Regan\\'s hand reaches out to him. He climbs aboard and opens his mouth to reveal Regan\\'s hearing aid. They remove the noose and we see their boat heading to the island. In the corner of the screen an alien is stranded on top of a boat that has detached from the docks during the chaos.<br/><br/>Marcus is struggling to breathe and sees from the watch that he needs to open the door. He struggles with the door and eventually, distraught, gives up. He opens the baby\\'s trunk to find the baby screaming. With a pained expression he starts sharing the oxygen with the baby, until he falls asleep.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Evelyn returns to compound with the supplies and here\\'s an alien making a loud cry. She tries to explode the alien by shooting an oxygen tank but the alien is unscathed. The explosion does, however, trigger the fire sprinklers. The noise of the sprinklers helps Evelyn navigate around the alien and return to the basement. The alien does chase her though. Evelyn hides inside the bunker with Marcus and the infant, with the alien waiting outside the door for them.<br/><br/>Regan and Emmett approach the island, where they find a colony of people living normal lives after isolating themselves to the island. After the government realized the creatures could not swim, the National Guard had as many people as possible put on the islands. However, one of the creatures manages to get to the island on another boat and kills several civilians. However, they lure the creature away to where the radio station is, and it follows them inside. The alien eventually hears Regan and Emmett, slicing Emmett with its claws. However, as it goes after Regan, she is able to change the sound coming from the station from the song to the noise her hearing aid produced weakening the creature, as she eventually kills it with a pole. Marcus, picking up the signal through the radio, also uses the noise to weaken the creature, shooting it dead, now allowing anyone to be able to kill the creatures.</div></div>'}\n",

Kirk (Chris Pine) is meeting with the Teenaxi people to make a treaty between them and their enemies, the Fenopians. Kirk is holding an artifact that he claims is a gift of peace from the Fenopians, but the Teenaxi leader considers this a threat. He rolls down to confront Kirk, where we see that the leader and the rest of his people are small creatures. However, they gang up on Kirk and attack him. Kirk calls for Scotty (Simon Pegg) to beam him back up to the USS Enterprise. Kirk records a log, stating that they are now about three years into their five-year mission to explore the ends of the universe. Kirk has become rather bored by this point, and he wonders what else there is to see out there.<br/><br/>Kirk is joined by Dr. Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban) with a bottle of scotch that he took out of Mr. Chekov\\'s (Anton Yelchin) locker. Bones notes that Kirk\\'s birthday is coming up, which Kirk isn\\'t looking forward to since it reminds him of how his father died on the same day, and how Kirk will be a year older than his father when he died. Bones states that Kirk has spent all this time figuring out who his father was in his life, and now he is wondering what it means to be Kirk himself. The crew descends onto Starbase Yorktown to replenish their supplies. Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) appear to be going through a rough patch in their relationship. She is ready to hand him back a necklace that he gave her, but he refuses to take it back. Mr. Sulu (John Cho) reunites with his life partner and their daughter. Spock is then called aside by two Vulcans ambassadors. He is informed that his older self from the prime timeline, Ambassador Spock, has died.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a distress signal is picked up by the Federation from an alien named Kalara (Lydia Wilson), who claims to have been part of a crew whose ship suffered a critical malfunction. She asks for help in rescuing her crew on the far side of the nebula. Kirk meets with Commodore Paris (Shohreh Aghdashloo) to apply for a position as Vice Admiral. He requests that Spock be made captain of the Enterprise in his place.<br/><br/>The Enterprise sets off on the rescue mission. As they proceed through the nebula, they approach a Class M planet, and are suddenly attacked by a massive cluster of ships that move like a swarm of insects. The swarm quickly causes heavy damage to the Enterprise, the aliens riding the small ships breaching the hull in a matter of minutes. The crew tries fighting back, but their weapons are not strong enough, and when Sulu tries to warp them out of there, Scotty reports that the ship\\'s nacelles have been sheered off by the enemy. The aliens then allow their leader, Krall (Idris Elba), to board the ship. His soldiers find the artifact that Kirk possessed earlier, a bioweapon called the Abronath. However, when Krall tries to get his hands on it, he finds that its container is empty. With the damage to the Enterprise critical, Kirk orders a general evacuation. Spock and Bones get in an escape pod that heads down to the planet. Krall battles with Kirk, winning the upper hand until Uhura separates the saucer from the engineering section of the ship, taking Krall with her. Kirk then goes with Chekov and Kalara as they make their escape. As the escape pod is ejected, Kirk watches the Enterprise crash to the ground.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Scotty\\'s escape pod nearly flies into a vast canyon, but he jumps out in time. He is cornered in the forest by the planet\\'s savage inhabitants. Before they can attack him, a scavenger named Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) shows up and beats the savages. Scotty introduces himself to her as an engineer. They agree to work together, with Scotty helping repair something of Jaylah\\'s, and she will help him find the rest of the crew. Jaylah takes Scotty to her home, which happens to be a long-lost Federation starship, the USS Franklin. Spock and Bones have also crash-landed, with Spock impaled by a chunk of metal in his abdomen. Bones manages to pull out the metal and stop the bleeding. The two navigate the area, but they must slow down since Spock is still badly wounded. As they sit down, Spock informs Bones about Ambassador Spock\\'s death. He feels that he must continue carrying out his older self\\'s work on New Vulcan, and he wanted to inform Kirk, but Bones says he probably would not like that.<br/><br/>After landing on the planet, Kirk confronts Kalara, thinking she knew what was coming. She defends herself, saying this was to help save her crew. With Chekov, they rush to find the Abronath on the saucer. Kalara then turns on Kirk, confirming she led them to a trap and that she was working with Krall the whole time. She finds that the Abronath is not where Kirk claimed to have left it. Moments later, the three are ambushed by drones. Kirk and Chekov manage to activate the saucer\\'s thrusters, which lift the saucer high enough until it crashes down hard, killing Kalara. Krall captures Uhura, along with Sulu and the rest of the crew. He and his soldiers take them to his base of operations. It is shown that Krall is able to drain people of their lifeforce to rejuvenate himself, as well as change his appearance. He threatens to kill Sulu for the Abronath, but an Ensign named Syl gives up the weapon, having kept it hidden in the back of her head. He brings Uhura and Syl into a chamber where he demonstrates the use of the weapon. He locks Syl in the chamber and activates the Abronath, releasing a black cloud that envelopes Syl causing her to decompose. Krall intends to use this against the Federation.<br/><br/>Kirk and Chekov run into a perimeter trap that Jaylah has arranged, encasing them in a crystallized shell. Scotty and Jaylah find them, and she breaks them free when Scotty says they are part of his crew. They team up to rescue the rest of the crew. Scotty repairs the Franklin\\'s transporter pad to teleport people onto the ship. They start with Spock and Bones, who are about to be killed by more drones until they are both beamed onto the Franklin. On the computer, they receive a signal on Uhura\\'s location since the necklace Spock gave her is also a tracking device. They see she is with the rest of the crew at Krall\\'s hideout, but Chekov says they are unable to beam everyone up from there. Kirk figures they need to head in there and come up with their own rescue plan. Jaylah wants no part of this since she knows people who go near Krall\\'s camp never come back alive. Her father fought Krall\\'s right-hand man Manas and was killed during her escape. Scotty says she is not alone and can work with the others to save the crew.<br/><br/>Kirk creates a diversion with a motorcycle he found on the Franklin while Spock and Bones sneak around to take a number of crew members at a time onto a pad and use a beacon to beam them onto the Franklin. Krall\\'s men attack, leading to Jaylah fighting Manas one-on-one. Kirk protects the crew by spreading the crystallizing material to shield them from Krall\\'s army. As the rest of the crew is saved, only Kirk and Jaylah remain. Jaylah pushes Manas off the pad to his death and jumps to reach Kirk as he activates his beacon, sending them back to the Franklin. Krall and his army fly toward Yorktown so he can activate the Abronath and kill everyone. The Enterprise crew follows. Spock and Bones beam onto a drone ship and figure out that they need to use a distraction to get by the other drones. Scotty uses Jaylah\\'s music system to create discordant noise with The Beastie Boys\\' song \"Sabotage\". The drones are obliterated, leaving only Krall\\'s ship plus two others. The Franklin manages to stop Krall\\'s ship, causing her to crash into a fountain.<br/><br/>The crew goes off to find Krall and make sure he is dead. They find two dead bodies drained of their lifeforce. As they continue making their way, they notice a video of the original crew of the Franklin from a century ago. Uhura spots a familiar face among everyone else. The man she sees is Balthazar Edison, the captain of the Franklin, but he is now Krall. Kirk asks to see Edison\\'s old logs, skipping to the last one to see Edison having become jaded and angry with the Federation after his ship was stranded with no help, following his crew\\'s own series of missions. Edison mentioned discovering a life-sustaining force that he intended to use to keep himself alive. A major in the United Earth Military Assault Command Operations (MACO), he became disillusioned with the Federation, rejecting its principles of unity and cooperation with former enemies.<br/><br/>Now looking slightly more like his former self, Krall takes the Abronath to Yorktown\\'s life support hub, which would allow the black cloud to spread through the entire starbase. Kirk finds Krall and starts fighting him to take the Abronath away from him. Kirk attempts to reason with Krall, but he is no longer the same captain he once was. Kirk\\'s crew attempts to open the doors into space to pull out Krall. Krall activates the Abronath, which starts releasing the black cloud. However, Kirk avoids getting killed and pushes Krall into the path of the cloud. The doors open and sucks Krall into space with the Abronath, where he is consumed by the cloud and is thus disintegrated. Kirk gets sucked into space as well, but Spock and Bones fly near the doors and pull him to safety.<br/><br/>In the aftermath, Commodore Paris closes the unsolved cases of Captain Edison and the USS Franklin crew. She offers Kirk the position of Vice Admiral, but he chooses to remain a captain since he chooses to fly. Meanwhile, Spock goes through Ambassador Spock\\'s old materials as he chooses to remain in Starfleet. Among them is a picture of the Enterprise crew in the prime timeline right before they retired. Bones then brings Kirk to a surprise birthday party with the whole crew there to celebrate. Spock and Uhura reconcile their relationship. Kirk and Scotty pull some strings and get Jaylah into Starfleet Academy. The main crew then sees the USS Enterprise-A is being constructed. With that, the crew recites the original final frontier monologue as they resume their mission.<br/><br/>The film closes with the words \"In loving memory of Leonard Nimoy\" (who had passed away in 2015) and \"For Anton\", a dedication to Anton Yelchin who passed away shortly before the film\\'s premiere in 2016.</div></div>'}\n",

Now, Professor X\\'s newest students--the teenage mutant with the deadly touch, Rogue, and the body-regenerating, adamantium-infused Logan, aka Wolverine--find themselves caught in the middle of a violent confrontation; one that would either stop or usher in a new era in the history of homo superior.

While Xavier wants a peaceful means of stopping the hatred toward mutants, Magneto seeks to even things out with a machine that would speed up the mutation process in all humans, making everyone equal. To stop Magneto, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called \"X-Men\" to stop him.

They are led by Magneto who harbors deep hatred for human race due to his tragic past as a boy Eric in Nazi ruled Poland and now has the ability to create magnetic field.<br/><br/>In US Congress, Senator Robert Kelly attempts to pass a \"Mutant Registration Act\", which would force mutants to publicly reveal their identities and abilities. Magneto begins his plans to fight against humans. Meanwhile, a mutant girl named Marie (a.k.a Rogue) discovers that the touch of her skin physically hurts that person by absorbing their energy/powers and runs away from her home in Mississippi.<br/><br/>In Canada, she meets another mutant Wolverine (a.k.a. Logan) who has quick healing power and retractable metallic claws which he brings out from inside his body when threatened. After a fight, Logan drives away in his truck and gives Rogue a lift. Suddenly, both of them are attacked by Sabretooth.<br/><br/>Cyclops &amp; Storm arrive and save Logan &amp; Rogue and bring them to Prof Xavier\\'s mansion. Prof Xavier reveals to Logan that he runs the facility in the disguise of a school where they educate young mutants in the responsible use of their powers, who may either rejoin the human society or stay there as \"X-Men\". Below the surface, they aim to stop Magneto from starting a war with humanity. Rogue joins the school and likes a boy named Bobby Drake there.<br/><br/>Senator Kelly, the face of anti-mutant public demonstrations, is abducted by Mystique &amp; Toad and taken to Magneto. Magneto runs a machine that emits a radiation on Kelly and artificially induces mutation, though Kelly manages to escape imprisonment with his new abilities. After an accident causes Rogue to absorb Logan\\'s powers, she is convinced by Mystique (disguised as Bobby) that others are now afraid of her and she should leave the school. Xavier has a machine called Cerebro to locate the mutants around and he uses that to locate the fleeing Rogue at a train station.<br/><br/>Mystique infiltrates Cerebro and sabotages the machine. Logan grabs a bike to reach the train station and convinces Rogue to stay with Xavier. Cyclops and Storm too reach the station searching for her but a fight ensues when Magneto, Toad and Sabretooth arrive and they take Rogue. Kelly, now a new mutant, seeks help of Dr Grey at Xavier\\'s school to cure him, but he dissolves into a puddle of water when his mutation becomes unstable.<br/><br/>Magneto brings Rogue to Liberty Island and places his machine atop the Statue of Liberty. He intends to use his machine on the world leaders who are meeting for a UN summit on nearby Ellis Island and change them into mutants. The X-Men learn that the machine draws its energy from Magneto and thus weakened him in previous use, to the point of nearly killing him, so he has abducted Rogue who can be used to absorb his powers and then be used to start his machine. Xavier attempts to use Cerebro to locate Rogue but the compromised machine sends him into a coma.<br/><br/>Jean fixes it and locates Rogue on Liberty Island. Logan, Jean, Cyclops and Storm take a jet to arrive at the top of the statue and a fight ensues with Mystique disguised as Logan. Toad is killed by Storm\\'s lightning and Mystique is apparently killed by Logan, but then Magneto incapacitates the group with his magnetic powers. The X-men tell Magneto that Kelly is dead and his machine is a killer, not converter. However Magneto goes ahead with his plan arguing it to be fair. Magneto transfers his powers to Rogue who is forced to sit inside the machine and then start it.<br/><br/>Logan breaks free and initiates a fight with Sabretooth. Cyclops, with Jean\\'s help, blasts his optic rays on Sabretooth smashing him out of the statue. With Jean stabilizing him, Storm creates a storm to propel Logan to the top of Magneto\\'s machine. With time running out, Logan attempts to stop the machine and save Rogue, but Magneto, now having regained some of his strength, halts Logan\\'s claws. Cyclops manages to find a clean shot, wounding Magneto and allowing Logan to destroy the machine and the radiation stops short of reaching the people.<br/><br/>Placing his hand to her face, Logan succeeds in transferring his regenerative abilities to a dying Rogue who recovers. Magneto is arrested. Professor Xavier recovers from his coma and the group finds that Mystique is still alive, now impersonating Senator Kelly.<br/><br/>In an attempt to help Logan learn more about his past, Xavier sends him to a military base near Alkali Lake. Xavier visits Magneto in his prison, who warns that he will continue his war, to which Xavier promises that he (and the X-Men) will always be there to stop him.</div></div>'}\n",

In East Berlin shape-shifting mutant Raven discovers Kurt Wagner, while En Sabah Nur recruits Psylocke and Angel, and enhances both of their powers. Can Professor Charles Xavier\\'s students defeat Apocalypse and save the world from destruction?</div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">Nile Valley, 3,600 B.C.<br/><br/>The people of Egypt are bowing down and chanting the name of En Sabah Nur (the ancient Egyptian language for \\'Apocalypse\\'), a powerful being. He is brought into his pyramid by his Four Horsemen - Pestilence (Warren Scherer), Famine (Rochelle Okoye), Death (Monique Ganderton), and War (Fraser Aitcheson). They are set to begin a process to transfer En Sabah Nur\\'s consciousness into the body of a younger successor (Oscar Isaac). As the sun hits the top of the pyramid, the process begins. Outside, the citizens of Egypt turn on their leader and send massive pillars sliding down into the pyramid to kill En Sabah Nur and the Horsemen. The Horsemen fight back against the other Egyptians as the pillars begin to destroy the pyramid. Death manages to form a protective shield on the successor before she and everyone else is crushed. The process is complete, but En Sabah Nur remains trapped beneath the rubble.<br/><br/>We jump to Ohio in the year 1983. A high school classroom is discussing the events of 10 years earlier when Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender) attacked the peace summit in Paris, and Raven Darkholme/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) stopped him. One student, Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan), complains that his eyes are hurting. A classmate mistakes it as him winking at his girlfriend. The teacher tells Scott to report to the principal\\'s office but he retreats to the bathroom and hides in a stall. The classmate enters and threatens to beat him. Scott then opens his eyes and releases a powerful blast that knocks the other kid against the wall and causes significant damage to the walls and ceiling. <br/><br/>In West Berlin, a bunch of people are gathered in a secret location to witness the mutant Angel (Ben Hardy) fighting a large fat mutant (possibly Blob). After taking him out, Angel prepares for his next challenger. Some men bring in the challenger locked inside a box. He is Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Nightcrawler is able to teleport as far as he can see, but within the cage where they fight is an electrical lining that prevents him from escaping. Meanwhile, Raven has made it in and she increases the voltage in the cage. Nightcrawler manages to take Angel down and pin him against the cage, frying Angel\\'s wings. With Raven\\'s help, Nightcrawler escapes the place.<br/><br/>Lensherr now lives in Poland under the name Henryk Gorzky. He works at a metal foundry and has a wife, Magda (Carolina Bartczak), and a daughter, Nina (T.J. McGibbon). Erik tells Nina a bedtime story that he heard from his parents. She asks him what happened to them, and Erik explains how his parents were taken from him.<br/><br/>Scott\\'s brother Alex/Havok (Lucas Till) takes him to Xavier\\'s School For Gifted Youngsters with bandages over his eyes to prevent another incident. Scott meets Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult), who is now a teacher, and then bumps into Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), a telepathic mutant. Alex brings Scott to Charles Xavier (James McAvoy). Scott removes his bandages to hit a target, but he ends up splitting a tree that Charles\\'s grandfather planted. Highly impressed, Charles says Scott is enrolled.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Raven brings Nightcrawler to a location where a mutant named Caliban (Tomas Lemarquis) is helping other mutants create fake IDs and passports. Nightcrawler gets his picture taken so that Raven can take him to the U.S.<br/><br/>In Egypt, an archeologist named Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) discovers a hidden underground chamber that leads to the resting place of En Sabah Nur. A group of his followers recite a chant that revives him in his fully powered Apocalypse form. The followers are buried by the ensuing explosion, while Moira manages to get out. The explosion triggers an earthquake that can be felt throughout most of the continent and in Europe, including in Erik\\'s workplace, where a large vat of molten metal falls and nearly crushes a man but Erik manages to manipulate it to save the man.<br/><br/>At night, the students at school feel that something is wrong. Charles tells them all to stay in their rooms. He goes into Jean\\'s room where he finds she\\'s trembling and moaning. Charles looks inside her head and sees what she is dreaming of: she sees visions of chaos and destruction. Jean awakens and claims she saw the end of the world. She fears her powers, but Charles assures her that her power is great.<br/><br/>Back in Egypt, Ororo Monroe/Storm (Alexandra Shipp) uses her power of weather manipulation to create a brief sandstorm that allows her to rob two men. They chase after her, which Apocalypse sees after witnessing her power. He follows the men as they prepare to cut off her hand. Using his own power, Apocalypse decapitates three other men with sand, while he traps the last man within a nearby wall.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Erik tells Magda that they need to leave after feeling he has been exposed. They call for Nina, but she is not in her room or in the yard. Erik hears a noise in the woods, which he and Magda follow. Nina is being held by an officer leading a group of other officers. They confront Erik regarding the incident at the factory, as well as his attack on the White House a decade earlier. He confesses to it and pleads for Nina to be let go. She is released and goes back to her mother. Erik joins the other officers, but Nina yells at the men to not take her father away. The sound of her voice (she\\'s a mutant) causes the birds flying up above to attack the officers. One officer with a bow and arrow accidentally releases it, impaling both Nina and Magda. Erik runs to his family and cries. He takes off Nina\\'s necklace and uses as a high-powered projectile to kill all the men.<br/><br/>Charles and Hank go to Cerebro to find out what happened with the earthquake. He locates Moira in Egypt, clearly still in love with her. Charles and Alex take a trip to Langley at the CIA headquarters to visit Moira. She doesn\\'t remember knowing Charles since he wiped her memories, but she still knows who he is. Moira explains that she was investigating En Sabah Nur\\'s whereabouts and history, going into detail about his motives and followers, the Horsemen, and how he would give them special powers to aid him in destroying whatever they wanted.<br/><br/>Ororo then brings Apocalypse to her home. She has a poster of Mystique, whom she considers to be her hero. Apocalypse places his hand on the TV to catch himself up on the last few thousands of years. Based on what he\\'s seen, he determines that man has lost his way, and the world must be cleansed in order to be saved. He places his hand on Ororo and gives her powers added strength.<br/><br/>Raven brings Nightcrawler to the school. He meets Jubilee (Lana Condor), Jean, and Scott (who now has red-tinted crystal eyeglasses that help him see without hurting anyone). They decide to hang out at the mall and watch \"Return of the Jedi.\"<br/><br/>Apocalypse and Storm then go to Caliban\\'s facility to look for more powerful mutants. Caliban draws his gun on Apocalypse, but he turns it and the bullets to dust. As they step closer, Caliban is defended by Psylocke (Olivia Munn), a mutant with her own metal sword and a psychic katana. Clearly impressed, Apocalypse gives her an upgraded power.<br/><br/>Psylocke leads Apocalypse and Storm to their next recruit. They find Angel in an abandoned building, where he is drinking and blasting Metallica, clearly not the same fighter he was before. Apocalypse turns his wings into metal with bladed feathers.<br/><br/>Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver (Evan Peters) is watching a news report on Magneto. His mother comes downstairs and he pretends to have been playing the video game Mrs. Pac-Man. She knows what he was really watching and why he was watching it.<br/><br/>Erik returns to the factory to confront his co-workers since they spoke to the police. He prepares to kill them all until Apocalypse, Storm, Psylocke, and Angel emerge. Apocalypse sinks the men beneath the ground and brings Erik to Auschwitz where he first used his powers and where he lost his family. Apocalypse encourages him to manipulate the metal in the earth, and to use his anger to fuel his energy. Erik begins to destroy the other buildings around him as Apocalypse vows to build a better world.<br/><br/>Charles brings Raven, Hank, Alex, and Moira down to Cerebro to locate Erik. Charles finds him as Magneto once again, now having joined Apocalypse and the Horsemen. As Magneto speaks to Charles, Apocalypse sees the opportunity to link his mind to Charles\\'s, which also lets him get into Cerebro and connect to anyone he wants. Apocalypse manipulates officials around the globe to launch all of their nukes into space so that no one, human or mutant, can stop him. Charles is overwhelmed by Apocalypse\\'s power. He orders Alex to destroy Cerebro, which he does. The others pull Charles out of the room, only to encounter Apocalypse and the Horsemen appearing before them. Magneto pulls Charles in his chair and takes him. Alex releases a blast that causes a powerful explosion. Outside, Quicksilver arrives in time to do a power run through the school and evacuate everyone before the entire school is destroyed. However, he failed to save Alex, which Scott finds out about just as he and his friends return. He breaks down at the revelation.<br/><br/>A chopper then descends to the ground. Moira approaches them, thinking they are part of another agency, until the leader steps out and removes his mask. It\\'s William Stryker (Josh Helman). His men fire a sonic blast that incapacitates everyone, except for Scott, Jean, and Nightcrawler. Jean manages to keep them hidden by manipulating the mind of one of Stryker\\'s men. Stryker captures Raven, Moira, Hank, and Peter. Nightcrawler teleports himself, Scott, and Jean into their chopper, but he cannot get anyone out because of the electrical lining within.<br/><br/>Stryker takes everyone to his facility and traps Moira and the mutants in a room. Hank has re-mutated to Beast since he left his meds at home. Scott, Jean, and Nightcrawler sneak by the guards until they are spotted, forcing Nightcrawler to teleport them again. Simultaneously, Apocalypse brings Charles and the Horsemen to his old home and uses Charles to send a message to everyone on the planet, but Charles manages to get a hidden message to Jean to help her.<br/><br/>In the cell, Peter admits to Raven that Magneto is his father, and he was hoping to be able to tell him.<br/><br/>The three then come across a room with a chamber that has something locked up, angry and growling. As the guards approach, Jean opens the chamber, unleashing Weapon X ...aka WOLVERINE (Hugh Jackman). He gets his metal claws out and slaughters all the guards until he reaches an exit. Jean stops Wolverine and gently removes his brainwashing mechanism. She taps into his mind and gives him back the memories she could reach. Without a word, Wolverine retreats outside. The three then reach the cell, and Scott blasts the cell door open to release Moira and the mutants.<br/><br/>Apocalypse destroys part of Egypt to recreate his own pyramid, and then gets Magneto to manipulate the magnetic poles to cause global destruction. Apocalypse then tells Charles he has the most important role in his plan. He wants to transfer his consciousness into Charles so that he can control everyone on the planet.<br/><br/>Moira and the mutants fly toward Cairo to rescue Charles and defeat Apocalypse. Raven tells the others about her old team, and how she and Hank are the only ones left. Jean tells Raven she\\'s a hero, but she doesn\\'t see herself that way.<br/><br/>The team reaches Cairo for the showdown. Beast and the young trio prepare for battle while Quicksilver and Raven (morphing into her natural Mystique form) head toward Magneto. She urges the trio to not hold back on their powers. Mystique and Quicksilver reach Magneto in the middle of his destruction, trying to convince him to fight for the good, with Mystique assuring him he has more family than he realizes. Quicksilver is about to tell Magneto of their relation, but he holds it back.<br/><br/>Storm, Angel, and Psylocke come down and fight. Storm hurls lightning toward Scott, which he deflects with his beams. Psylocke uses her blades against Beast. Angel goes for a rematch with Nightcrawler. Nightcrawler traps Angel and heads into the pyramid to get Charles out in the middle of the transfer process. They and the other heroes make it back into their jet, but Angel and Psylocke reach them and try to break in. Nightcrawler gets everyone out of the jet as it crashes to the ground, killing Angel while Psylocke jumps to safety.<br/><br/>An infuriated Apocalypse catches Quicksilver as he uses his super-speed to get some punches in, but Apocalypse traps his foot in the ground and breaks his leg. He orders Psylocke to execute him. Psylocke uses her katana to slash Apocalypse\\'s throat. He grabs her by the neck, revealing Mystique in disguise. Storm watches as Apocalypse is killing her hero.<br/><br/>The others are in a building for safety. Charles realizes he is still connected to Apocalypse and decides to fight him in their shared consciousness. Charles initially appears to have the upper hand, but Apocalypse overpowers him and starts trying to kill him. Magneto then turns on Apocalypse after realizing what side he\\'s meant to fight on. As he holds Apocalypse off, Charles reaches Jean and gets her to tap into the fight with her mind. She manages to unleash her full Phoenix Force power to overwhelm Apocalypse. As he weakens, he tries to escape, but Storm uses her lightning to prevent him for leaving. Apocalypse\\'s form deteriorates until he is finally disintegrated. After the battle, Psylocke quietly walks away.<br/><br/>The team returns home. Erik and Jean help rebuild the school to its original form. Ororo asks Peter if he\\'ll tell Erik he is Erik\\'s son. He says he will eventually. He and Ororo decide to stick around.<br/><br/>Although Charles asks Erik to stay, he chooses to leave, but he remains friends with Charles. Charles then goes to the Danger Room where Mystique is about to train Scott (now Cyclops), Jean, Storm, Quicksilver, and Nightcrawler into becoming true X-Men. A simulation then begins in which the students must battle Sentinels.<br/><br/>After the end credits, a team of agents are at Stryker\\'s facility. One man takes a sample of Wolverine\\'s blood and puts it in a briefcase... which belongs to the Essex Corporation.</div></div>'}\n",

As he stands on a ridge looking around, a two-headed lizard crawls near Max and he stomps on it before eating it. He drives off and is quickly pursued by a group of scavengers called the War Boys, all pale and covered in blisters due to radiation sickness. They chase Max through the desert and force him to crash before they capture him.<br/><br/>The War Boys take Max to their lair in the Citadel, a system of caves in a very tall mesa. They shave his head and face. They tattoo his back with a notice saying he is a universal blood donor (type O negative), intending to use him as a blood supply. They cover the lower part of his face with a trident-shaped iron muzzle and nearly brand him with an image of a skull engulfed in fire but he breaks free and runs from the War Boys. The chase through the caves shows that the Citadel is extensive and has an ample water supply as well as greenhouses. As he runs, Max continues to see images of the dead before he makes it to an exit high above the ground. He jumps out and latches onto a swinging hook, but he keeps swinging back toward the War Boys and they manage to pull him back into the tunnel.<br/><br/>In the Citadel, there is a large community of survivors lorded over by the leader of the War Boys, Immortan Joe (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0117412/?ref_=ttpl\">Hugh Keays-Byrne</a>, who also played the villain Toecutter in the original <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/title/tt0079501/?ref_=ttpl\">Mad Max (1979)</a> film). Joe wears a grotesque face mask made of horse teeth set in a large pair of jaws, with air hoses attached to a bellows system on his back to help him breathe (presumably, his lungs are damaged). As he addresses a crowd on the ground below the Citadel, he supplies the people with some water, making everyone go crazy and fight for it once Joe shuts it off after a few seconds. He warns the people not to become addicted to water so that they do not go mad over its absence. Joe then sends his commander Imperator Furiosa (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000234/?ref_=ttpl\">Charlize Theron</a>) out in a huge war rig to collect fuel from Gas Town, with an escort of War Boys in smaller vehicles. Furiosa has a metal prosthesis in place of her lower left arm and hand.<br/><br/>On the road, Furiosa diverts from the path to Gas Town (glimpsed as a distant group of oil refineries) and heads east. Joe is alerted to the change and runs to the locked chambers where he keeps his five wives (young women chosen to breed his children). They\\'re all gone, and writing on the walls says \"Our children will not be warlords\" and \"Who killed the world?\" An old woman tells Joe that he cannot own a human. Furiosa is taking the women away from Joe, prompting him to rally the War Boys and go after her. All the War Boys are eager to join the chase, but one called Nux (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0396558/?ref_=ttpl\">Nicholas Hoult</a>) is so weak that he needs a \"blood bank\" -- which means Max goes along for the ride, chained to Nux and connected to the driver via a central line transfusion tube. The War Boys believe that Immortan Joe can deliver them to the gates of Valhalla, so Nux is willing to risk death in service to his leader.<br/><br/>The War Boys ride after Furiosa\\'s war rig, which is attacked by another scavenging tribe, the Buzzards. Nux straps Max to the hood of his car like the figurehead on a ship and eagerly chases Furiosa alongside the others. They attempt to get close to the rig, but Furiosa shakes most of them off, the War Boys aiding in the battle with explosive-tipped spears. Nux gets close to the rig as Max attempts to break free. Furiosa drives toward a enormous oncoming sand storm. Nux continues to chase her, even as they head into treacherous sand tornadoes. A few War Boys are killed in the storm, while Nux plots a kamikaze run by spilling his fuel inside his car. He plans to set it ablaze with a flare when Max is able to overpower and stop him. The two crash in the storm.<br/><br/>Max awakens to find himself still chained to an unconscious Nux and still wearing his muzzle. He grabs a shotgun and tries to shoot off Nux\\'s wrist, but the gun misfires. He spots Furiosa\\'s rig and walks there, finding five beautiful women -- the Splendid Angharad (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm2492819/?ref_=ttpl\">Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</a>), Toast the Knowing (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm2368789/?ref_=ttpl\">Zoë Kravitz</a>), Capable (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm2142336/?ref_=ttpl\">Riley Keough</a>), Cheedo the Fragile (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm5196907/?ref_=ttpl\">Courtney Eaton</a>), and the Dag (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm3880181/?ref_=ttpl\">Abbey Lee</a>) -- cleaning themselves with a hose and removing their chastity belts with bolt cutters. Splendid is nine months pregnant with Joe\\'s child, and Dag is also carrying his baby. Max points the shotgun at the women and demands the hose. He drinks, then tells them to use the cutters to cut off his chain. Dag tries to but cannot break it. Furiosa sees in the distance that Joe has gathered reinforcements from the other towns that supply gas and ammunition to the Citadel. The approaching forces are led by the People Eater (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0397398/?ref_=ttpl\">John Howard</a>) and the Bullet Farmer (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0141885/?ref_=ttpl\">Richard Carter</a>). Max and Furiosa fight as he tries to cut the chain that ties him to Nux. Nux wakes up and helps Max fight Furiosa, who is assisted by the other women. Nux cuts the chain and Max tries to take the rig for himself. However, it stalls because Furiosa installed a kill switch and only she knows how to start it again. Max lets her back on the rig but he doesn\\'t want to take the rest of the women. Furiosa insists that they come along, as she is guiding them to a location she calls the Green Place. When Furiosa explains that Joe\\'s \"gratitude\" toward Max will probably be a slow, painful death, Max gives in and as they ride off in the war rig, Nux sneaks on board. He disconnects the brake line to the fuel pod, slowing the rig down. Max crawls out on the tanker and reconnects the line. During this leg of the chase, Max is able to remove his face mask with a file given to him by Furiosa.<br/><br/>Furiosa drives the rig into a canyon where she has an arrangement with a group of biker bandits: they\\'ll close the pass behind her with a rock slide to foil her pursuers in exchange for the 3000 gallons of fuel in the trailer pod. She teaches Max the sequence of switches to throw to defeat the kill switch, then asks his name. He doesn\\'t want to tell her, so she says \"When I yell \\'Fool\\', drive out of here fast.\" They spot Joe and his forces closing in. Furiosa gets out and shouts to the bikers that she\\'s brought the 3000 gallons of fuel, as agreed, and she\\'ll detach the pod. One of the bikers complains that she said there would be a few pursuers, but there are three large parties. Furiosa, dodging to put the rig between herself and the bikers, yells \"Fool!\" and manages, between bullets, to climb back on as Max drives the rig away. Though she never did detach the fuel trailer, the the bikers blow up the overpass, temporarily halting Joe\\'s pursuit. As they race away, Furiosa and Max fight off the biker bandits with their respective talents for marksmanship.<br/><br/>Immortan Joe, in his large-wheeled, off-road vehicle, is able to climb over the rockfall. He\\'s joined by Nux, who proves that Splendid is on Furiosa\\'s rig with a scrap of cloth he\\'d taken from her. Another chase ensues through the desert. The War Boys keep trying to overtake the rig while Joe catches up. He attempts to shoot at the rig until Splendid steps out as a human shield, and Joe cannot do a thing without hurting his potential son. Nux attempts to help Joe, who sprays chrome paint on Nux\\'s mouth with the promise of bringing him to the gates of Valhalla if Nux succeeds. Almost immediately, Nux loses his gun in front of Joe, who continues driving with disappointment. Splendid tries climbing back to the front of the rig, but she falls off and is run over by Joe\\'s car. The women tell Max to turn back, but when he tells Furiosa that Splendid went under the wheels, Furiosa says they must keep going. The others cry for Splendid. Behind them, Joe screams in rage while holding Splendid\\'s body.<br/><br/>Nux slips back into the rig with the promise of helping the women evade Joe. He lies on the floor, distraught that he has failed Joe yet again and has lost his chance of joining his personal army. Capable consoles him. At the front, Furiosa tells Max of the Green Place and how she was taken from it as a child.<br/><br/>As they continue driving through the night, the rig becomes stuck in a large field of mud. The Bullet Farmer is not far behind them. Max shoots at him but misses, and then Furiosa gets a clean shot, taking out the Bullet Farmer\\'s lights and blinding him. Nux suggests they attach the truck\\'s winch cable to a nearby tree and pull the rig forward.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Joe\\'s lieutenant the Organic Mechanic (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0760151/?ref_=ttpl\">Angus Sampson</a>) takes Splendid\\'s body, as she is near death, and he cuts the baby out of her abdomen. The baby is dead too, but he tells Joe that it was a boy. Joe tells his adult son Rictus (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0428923/?ref_=ttpl\">Nathan Jones</a>) that he had a brother. Rictus screams proudly. The women continue trying to push the rig out of the mud while Max goes out to face the Bullet Farmer himself. A few bright flashes of explosions are seen in the distant fog and he returns shortly with the Bullet Farmer\\'s blood on his face, along with a nice supply of guns and ammo.<br/><br/>In the morning, the rig comes up to a tower where a naked woman, the Valkyrie (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0301885/?ref_=ttpl\">Megan Gale</a>), is screaming for help. Max thinks it\\'s a trap, but Furiosa steps out and tells the Valkyrie her mother\\'s name and her affiliation with this clan. The Valkyrie climbs down the tower and puts on a robe. More older women, the Vuvalini, emerge. The eldest, Keeper of the Seeds (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0415513/?ref_=ttpl\">Melissa Jaffer</a>), recognizes Furiosa. Furiosa tells them that she is taking the women from the Citadel to the Green Place, but Keeper of the Seeds informs her that the muddy swamp they passed through was the Green Place, and has long since become uninhabitable. Furiosa walks into the sand and falls on her knees, screaming in despair. The Vuvalini agree to help the women from the Citadel ride across the salt flats (the dried up ocean) in search of a home. Max, still haunted by the images of his wife and child, decides to help the women go back to the Citadel since Joe\\'s greenery and water supply are currently unguarded. They also plan to trap Joe and his army in the canyons.<br/><br/>The group rides back in the direction of the Citadel. Joe sees them with his telescope, knowing full-well what their plan is. He gathers his army and gives chase. The Vuvalini help fight back. The Valkyrie shoots at the War Boys while defending one of her own until she is run over. Max and Furiosa kill some of the War Boys, while Max gets Joe to kill the People Eater by using him as a human shield. Keeper of the Seeds is also killed when one of the War Boys cuts her neck. Toast is captured by Joe and held hostage. Furiosa is stabbed on Joe\\'s vehicle and grows weaker as Joe and Rictus gain momentum. Toast distracts Joe long enough to give Furiosa an opportunity to hook Joe\\'s mask onto the wheels of his car. She growls, \"Remember me?\" to him as the wheels rip the mask and part of Joe\\'s face off, killing him. The rig then heads toward the canyon, with Rictus still trying to stop them. The women get off safely while Nux says goodbye to Capable and swerves against the canyon, sacrificing himself to kill Rictus and collapse the overpass to put an end to Joe\\'s army.<br/><br/>On the way back to the Citadel, Furiosa\\'s lungs nearly collapse. Max punches a small hole in her side to give her air. She starts to lose consciousness, and Max gives her a transfusion of his own blood. He finally tells her his name as she closes her eyes.<br/><br/>The group arrives at the Citadel. Max presents the people with Joe\\'s mouthless corpse, making everyone cheer. They rip Joe\\'s corpse apart and feed off him. The water supply is brought out, giving the people as much water as they need. Furiosa rises and apparently becomes the new leader. She and Max acknowledge each other with respect once more before he slips away into the crowd to continue down his own path.</div></div>'}\n",

While Duke and Ripcord train to join the Joes, McCullen (\"Destro\") is secretly working for Cobra and plotting to recapture his metal-eating \"Nanomite\" warheads.

The Scotsman Klan McCullen has been accused of selling weaponry to both the Scots and French. Rather than being executed for treason, the jury brands his face with a white-hot mask in order to humiliate him. In the near future, weapons expert James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) has created a nanotechnology-based weapon capable of destroying an entire city. His company MARS sells four warheads to NATO, and the U.S. Army is tasked with delivering the warheads. Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) are delivering the warheads when they are ambushed by the Baroness (Sienna Miller), who Duke recognized to be his ex-fiancee Ana Lewis. Duke and Ripcord are rescued by Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). They take the warheads to The Pit, G.I. Joe\\'s command center in North Africa, and upon arriving rendezvous with General Hawk (Dennis Quaid), the head of the G.I. Joe Team. Hawk takes command of the war-heads and excuses Duke and Ripcord, only to be convinced to have them join his group after Duke reveals that he knows the Baroness.<br/><br/>McCullen is revealed to be using the same nanotechnology to build an army of soldiers with the aid of the Doctor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), planning on using the warheads to bring panic and bring about a new world order. Using a tracking device, McCullen locates the G.I. Joe base and sends Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun) and the Baroness to retrieve the warheads with assistance from Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), inflicting casualties on several G.I. Joe soldiers. After a fight, Storm Shadow and the Baroness retrieve the warheads and take them to Baron DeCobray, the Baroness\\'s husband, for him to weaponize and use them to destroy the Eiffel Tower to serve as a showing of the warhead\\'s destructive power. Making their way to Paris, the Joes pursue them through the streets but are unsuccessful in stopping them from launching the missile. Duke manages to hit the kill switch, but in doing so he is captured and taken to McCullen\\'s base under the Arctic.<br/><br/>G.I. Joe locates the secret base and fly there as McCullen loads three missiles with nano-mite warheads. After Snake Eyes takes out one, Ripcord pursues the remaining missiles in a prototype Night Raven jet while Scarlett and her group infiltrate the base. While Scarlett and Snake Eyes attempt to shut down the Arctic base, with Heavy Duty leading an attack on Cobra\\'s forces, Duke learns that the Doctor is Rex Lewis, Ana\\'s brother believed to have been killed on a mission led by Duke four years ago. He was trapped in a bunker with Doctor Mindbender (Kevin O\\'Connor), disfigured in the blast which everyone presumed had killed him. The Baroness tries to free Duke but the Doctor reveals he has implanted her with nano-mites which has put her under his control for the past four years, admitting his amazement that she is resisting the programming. Attempting to kill Duke, McCullen ends up being facially burned as he flees with Rex to an escape vessel. Duke and the Baroness pursue him while the Joes fall back when Rex activated the base\\'s self destruct sequence.<br/><br/>Rex then heals McCullen\\'s burned face with nano-mites, encasing it in silver as he christens McCullen \"Destro\" and assumes the identity of Cobra Commander before they are captured by G.I. Joe soon after. On board the supercarrier USS Flagg, Baroness is placed in protective custody until they can remove the nano-mites from her body. Meanwhile, Zartan, having been earlier operated on by Rex, infiltrates the White House during the missile crisis and assumes the identity of the President of the United States (Jonathan Pryce).</div></div>'}\n",

A rusty old ship rests on land, seemingly deserted for ages. Lake Michigan appears to be mostly dried up. We move to the rest of the area, where people are walking around wearing uniforms of identical colors to match their place of living. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) explains that after a great war, society was divided into five separate areas called factions to maintain order.<br/><br/>The Erudite faction is for the smartest and most logical-thinking people. They dress in a dark shade of blue.<br/><br/>The Amity faction is meant for the kind and peaceful. They grow crops and provide for other factions. They dress in orange and yellow.<br/><br/>The Candor faction values honesty, and they dress in black and white.<br/><br/>The most fearless go to the Dauntless faction. They are the protectors of the nation, and they are known for their bravery as much as they are known for their crazy behavior. Their uniforms are black.<br/><br/>Beatrice and her family reside in the Abnegation faction. They wear light grey clothes and are selfless and do not value power, giving them the nickname \"Stiffs.\" They provide for the factionless, those who have no place to call home (basically the homeless population of the city). Because of this selfless demeanor, Abnegation forms the city\\'s government. Beatrice\\'s father Andrew (Tony Goldwyn) works closely with the Abnegation leader Marcus Eaton (Ray Stevenson). Her main concern is that she does not know where she really belongs.<br/><br/>Beatrice\\'s mother Natalie (Ashley Judd) cuts her hair and only allows her a brief amount of time to see her reflection to avoid vanity. It is the day of Beatrice\\'s aptitude test, along with her twin brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort), in which they will find out which faction they are best suited for. She asks her mother if she was nervous when she took her test. Natalie says \\'No. I was terrified.\\'<br/><br/>Beatrice and Caleb go to the station where other 16-year-olds from the other factions are taking their aptitude tests. A Candor member, named Peter (Miles Teller), mocks the Abnegation kids and blames them for the dwindling supplies. Beatrice continues to wonder just where she will fit in. After the kids are all put through a brief history of the test and its origins, she gets up to take the test, monitored by a woman named Tori (Maggie Q). She puts Beatrice in a chair and has her drink a blue serum to start the test. Beatrice closes her eyes and then opens them to find herself alone, with Tori no longer standing by her side. She gets up and sees her reflection. She keeps turning her head and sees more and more reflections. Then there appears to be a rabid dog. It growls at Beatrice and then runs toward her. She closes her eyes and then sees it as a puppy. Her younger self appears, wanting to play with the puppy. It reverts to its mangy dog form, running to attack the little Beatrice. The older one runs after the dog, and they sink through the floor. Beatrice awakens with a jolt. Tori is in a panicked state. Beatrice asks her what the results were. Tori says they were inconclusive. According to the results, Beatrice is suited for Abnegation, but also Erudite and Dauntless. This is a rare case, known as Divergent; being suited for more than one faction. Tori tells her to go home and say she was sick from the serum.<br/><br/>When Beatrice gets home, she is hesitant to tell her family what her results were. She just says she got Abnegation again. Andrew says that he needs to resolve matters with Abnegation as there is trouble going on with the faction\\'s helping of the factionless, as well as a rumor being spread that Marcus hit his own son. It\\'s also hinted that Erudite wants to be the ruling faction, instead of Abnegation.<br/><br/>The day of the Choosing Ceremony arrives. The Prior kids meet the Erudite leader, Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet). It is suggested that someone in Erudite (most likely her) has been spreading the rumor about Marcus. Once the ceremony commences, the new initiates step up to a table with five bowls and a knife. They cut their hands and give a drop of blood into these bowls to choose their factions. Caleb chooses Erudite. There is scattered applause in Abnegation but the Erudite members proudly welcome him. Beatrice goes up, nervous. She cuts her hand and almost drops blood into Abnegation, but then decides on Dauntless. Her parents are surprised, and the Dauntless members welcome her. The initiates leave with their factions, and Beatrice looks at her mother one last time.<br/><br/>Beatrice arrives in the Dauntless faction with all the other initiates. They run wild, climbing to the top of the elevated train tracks and chasing after the train as it goes so they can hop onto it before it\\'s too late. Beatrice meets a Candor initiative, named Christina (Zoe Kravitz). They then have to jump off the moving train onto a rooftop. Dauntless leader Eric (Jai Courtney) gathers everyone over the edge of the rooftop for them to jump into a hole. He asks for a volunteer to go first, and Beatrice steps forward. After some hesitation, she jumps into the hole and lands on a net. She is pulled out by Dauntless instructor Four (Theo James). He asks for her name, and she decides to call herself \\'Tris\\'. When everybody else comes down, he leads the initiates to The Pit, where everybody is having fun and they get to eat. There, Tris meets an Erudite initiative named Will (Ben Lloyd-Hughes) and Christina\\'s friend from Candor, Al (Christian Madsen). Another Dauntless leader, Max (Mekhi Phifer), comes out to greet the initiatives and welcome them to Dauntless. The initiatives, including Tris and Christina, get carried away proudly.<br/><br/>The initiates are given new all-black Dauntless clothing and set to begin training for them to prove they are worthy of staying in Dauntless. Eric warns them that if they fail to reach the top ranks, they will be kicked out of Dauntless and stay factionless, unable to return to their old homes. The first stage of training is combat where the initiatives fight against each other. Tris is put up against the last person to jump into the hole, a girl named Molly (Amy Newbold). Molly beats Tris easily. Additionally, she does not fare well in shooting practice or other tests. Four and Eric sneer at Tris and doubt her ability to keep up. To cheer her up, Christina, Will, and Al take her to a parlor to get tattoos. There, Tris finds Tori and follows her, even though it looks like she\\'s trying to avoid her. She warns Tris that she shouldn\\'t have chosen Dauntless as her new faction, because there are people looking for Divergents. She gives Tris a tattoo of three flying birds.<br/><br/>Tris practices fighting on a punching bag, with Four coming to watch. He tells her she\\'s weak, but fast, and her moves won\\'t work. He positions her properly and gives her tips on what moves she should use. Meanwhile, Christina is fighting Molly, getting beaten pretty badly. Christina is knocked to the floor and recoils from Molly, pleading for no more. Eric asks Christina if she wants to give up, and she says yes. He helps her on her feet and guides her somewhere. They walk over a bridge that stands over a deep chasm. Eric asks her if she\\'s feeling better and then pushes her off the bridge. Christina grabs onto it for dear life, and Eric times her to make a choice - hang on and he will forget her cowardice, let go and die, or give up and force herself out of the faction. She almost slips off until the time is up, and she\\'s still hanging on. Tris and Four pull her out as she cries. Eric reminds them that Dauntless cannot be afraid of anything nor can they ever give up.<br/><br/>The initiates then practice throwing knives at targets. Al throws his knife weakly and it doesn\\'t hit anywhere close to the target. Eric tells him to go get it, but Al refuses to as everybody is throwing their knives. Eric stops everybody and forces Al to stand in front of the target. Before Eric throws his knife, Tris tells him that this won\\'t prove anything. Eric makes her take Al\\'s place. Four grabs four knives to throw. He throws the first one far away from Tris, but gets closer with each knife until he throws the last one close enough to cut Tris\\'s ear. After the practice, she tells Four that he cut her, but he says Eric wouldn\\'t have let her out of there if she was left without a scratch. The other initiatives, including Molly, congratulate Tris. Peter approaches her to congratulate her sarcastically while adding that there is a news report on both Tris and Caleb and their both choosing to leave Abnegation for other factions.<br/><br/>The next day, Jeanine and a couple of Erudite Council members go into Dauntless, as it is implied they are searching for the Divergents. Tris never reveals her status, but Jeanine tells her to let her know if she needs anything.<br/><br/>Tris is set up to fight against Peter. Four reminds her of the moves he told her about, which is to dodge her opponent\\'s move and go for his throat first. Four also tells Tris that Peter always steps in before striking. Peter, being significantly bigger than Tris, has something of an upper hand, but Tris hits him in the throat as planned. However, he still ends up beating her hard, knocking her down, and then knocks her out with a stomp to the face.<br/><br/>When she wakes up, Tris sees Christina and Will standing by her side with black jackets. Will tells Tris she\\'s been out for a day and that Eric has decided to cut her from the faction. Her friends leave to join the other Dauntless initiates on the moving train. Tris, not ready to be thrown out, runs after the train and hops on. Eric is slightly impressed by her determination and allows her to join in on their game. Both Eric and Four gather up members for their team in an extreme version of Capture The Flag, with everyone carrying guns full of darts that simulate the pain of a gunshot. They are all taken to an abandoned amusement park, are divided into two opposing sides, and Four\\'s team tries to come up with strategies on taking the other team down. Tris appears to want to say something, but impatient with all the discussion she simply acts alone to get an idea of where their opponents\\' flag &amp; forces are from a better, higher vantage point. So she begins to climb the huge Ferris Wheel. Four follows her, though he looks uneasy climbing up. Tris realizes that he\\'s afraid of heights. They get their view on the other team and lead their team into an smart attack. Together, Tris and Four shoot through Peter and Eric, and Tris takes Molly down, and with Christina they gain the flag and emerge victorious. As part of a final Dauntless initiation, Tris joins the others on a crazy zipline over the city. She pulls the braking cable just before she hits the wall at the end of the line.<br/><br/>The next day, the Dauntless initiates are taking in bags of supplies from Amity and loading them onto trucks. Tris sees a light flashing in her eyes as if somebody is trying to get her attention. She walks behind the trucks and finds her mother had signaled. They hug. Natalie asks Tris if she really got Dauntless for her aptitude test. She admits her results were inconclusive. Natalie warns her not to let anybody know about this and to be safe, because Erudite is hunting down Divergents, believing they are a threat to their system since they do not conform to just one faction and are capable of free-thinking. Tris then asks Natalie if she was Dauntless. She leaves before answering.<br/><br/>Tris\\'s ranking rises above the dreaded red line, keeping her right above Al. Her current position is #20. The next stage of training is a simulation room to test out the initiates\\' control of their fears. Molly walks out of the room, shaking and trembling. Four oversees Tris\\'s test. As the simulation begins, Tris sees herself in a field outside a town, behind a fence near the Amity faction. A flock of crows fly over her and swoop down to attack Tris. She tries to run but gets stuck in mud. The crows surround her, but she tells herself \"This isn\\'t real,\" and she swims into what looks like a puddle but actually holds a larger body of water. Tris is snapped out of the simulation. Four asks her how she got out of there so quickly. She only lasted three minutes, quicker than most initiates. Tris says she just got into the water. Her second simulation has her coming up to her friends, but she is trapped by an invisible wall. Christina appears to laugh at her and then talks to Peter. Tris realizes she is in a tank that slowly fills up with water. It starts to fill up to the top until she is completely submerged. She sees her reflection and once again tells herself, \"This isn\\'t real.\" She taps the glass lightly, but it somehow causes a big crack before finally breaking completely. She wakes up from the simulation again, and Four once more questions how she got out of there so fast. He\\'s noticeably suspicious, and tells Tris that no Dauntless has ever completed the simulation so quickly.<br/><br/>Tris goes to visit Tori. She reveals to Tris that her brother George was Divergent but he chose Dauntless as his faction. When he was found out, he was dropped into the chasm.<br/><br/>Tris goes to Erudite headquarters to visit Caleb. The other Erudite members look at her with surprise to see a Dauntless member in there. Tris tells Caleb that she thinks Erudite is planning to take over the other factions, starting with Abnegation. Caleb, now acting and thinking like a real Erudite, agrees, but maintains his devotion to his faction over his family (\"faction over blood\"). Tris tearfully leaves when she realizes her brother won\\'t help her. She is stopped by two Erudite officials trying to take her in. She punches one of them and tries attacking the other when Jeanine stops them. She takes Tris into her office to refresh her. Jeanine reminds her of the need to maintain a balance in the system, as well as peace.<br/><br/>When Tris returns to Dauntless, she is caught by three masked guys. They carry her and nearly throw her into the chasm, but she fights herself out. She unmasks one of them, shocked to see it is Al. She fights them off and Four comes in to her rescue. He tends to her wounds, and she expresses disbelief that Al would attack her. Four says it\\'s because he\\'s trying to boost his ranks since he knows he\\'s close to getting kicked out. Later, when everybody is eating in The Pit, Al tries to apologize to Tris for what he did. She tells him to leave her alone and that she\\'ll kill him if he touches her. Afterwards, Tris and Christina come across the chasm where some Dauntless members are pulling out a body. It\\'s Al, having jumped to his death out of guilt. Tris feels somewhat responsible for this. Tris admits to Four she isn\\'t sure she\\'ll pass her final testing either. When Four asks why, Tris says that Four knows she is Divergent. Four acknowledges that he knows, and says he\\'s going to help her.<br/><br/>Four brings Tris into the simulation room where he lets her get inside his mind to show her his fears. They start off high above the city, simulating Four\\'s fear of heights. Tris suggests they jump because it\\'s not real, but Four says that\\'s something a Divergent would do. They need to overcome their fears the way a Dauntless would. They walk carefully over to the tower nearby to continue. They become trapped inside a vent, simulating Four\\'s fear of containment. The walls start closing in on the two of them. They discover some nails and wedge them into the wall-floor joint. This stops the walls from crushing them. Four\\'s next fear has him being forced to execute a factionless girl, but he cannot look at her with his gun aimed at her. Only by looking away can he fire. Finally, he and Tris find themselves in Abnegation - Four\\'s original faction. They\\'re in a house. Coming down the stairs is Marcus, holding a belt. Tris realizes that Four is Marcus\\'s son, Tobias Eaton. Marcus walks over with the belt to hit Four, but Tris fights him off, and the simulation ends. Tris and Four walk onto the balcony of his apartment. She realizes he is \"Four\" because of his four fears. He shows her the tattoos on his back. He has the symbols of each faction on his back. Four states that he doesn\\'t want to belong to just one faction. He wants to be kind, fearless, honest, selfless, and intelligent. This hints that he, too, is Divergent. The two of them kiss.<br/><br/>Later, Four shows Tris a few Erudite members bringing in supplies. He shows her a vial of an orange serum that is being used to make people more prone to suggestion.<br/><br/>Tris\\'s final test comes, with Jeanine and other Erudite members, along with the Dauntless members, watching her. She is sat down in a chair and is told that her hallucinations will be viewed on monitors. Her previous fears come back to her. She is almost attacked by crows again, but this time, she doesn\\'t jump in the water. She sees the field catching fire and grabs a burning branch to scare off the birds. Tris suddenly finds that she\\'s tied up and lashed to a stake among the burning field. She thrusts her bound wrists down so the fire burns the ropes, and then plunges her hands into the water as soon as she\\'s free. Next, she is back in the glass tank that fills up with water. Instead of breaking the glass, she takes off her jacket and plugs the pipe that sends the water in. She then finds herself in Four\\'s room. He goes to kiss her, but then gets aggressive. He throws her onto the bed as if to rape her, so she kicks him in the groin and throws him off. Tris appears to wake up from the simulation, hoping Four didn\\'t see the last bit. Jeanine comes over to hand Tris a gun as her parents and Caleb walk in. Jeanine tells Tris that she knows what to do. Tris refuses, but then hesitantly aims the gun at somebody (we don\\'t see who) and she pulls the trigger. This snaps her out of the simulation.<br/><br/>Tris is officially a Dauntless member. She and the other new members, including Will and Christina, are suited up and given guns as they line up for a mission. The Dauntless members are injected with a tracking device in case anybody gets lost, but Tris realizes they\\'ve actually been injected with the mind-control serum. As the Dauntless board the elevated train, Max and Eric see a man wandering out of line, uncertain of who to follow, leading them to realize he is a Divergent. Eric tells the man everything will be fine before he shoots him in the head. As the train carries the Dauntless, Tris very slowly and stealthily slips through the crowd until she is standing beside Four, and he takes hold of her hand. They are brought into the Abnegation neighborhood, ready to attack and round up the residents. The Dauntless members round up the Abnegation members, but Tris and Four refuse to join in the chaos. They are found out by Max and Eric, who conclude that both Tris and Four are Divergent. Eric aims his gun at Four, but Tris holds hers to Eric. Max aims at her, and Four aims at him. Tris and Four incapacitate both leaders and make a run for it, evading other antagonistic Dauntless members. They are then captured and brought to Jeanine. She recognizes Four as Tobias Eaton. He tries to attack her, but her guards hold him back. She has Four taken away while she orders Tris to be executed in a back alley. Before the villains can shoot her, they are shot by Natalie. She rescues her daughter, and Tris realizes that her mother was indeed a former Dauntless. They take their weapons to defend themselves. Will shoots at Tris and Natalie, and Tris has to kill him. She is upset that she had to do it, but her mother comforts her.<br/><br/>More Dauntless members appear to shoot at Tris and Natalie as they make a run for it. They fight back, but Natalie is shot in the side and quickly dies. Tris holds her mother and cries. She goes to find her father and Caleb in a safe house. She cries to her father, mourning Natalie\\'s death. Caleb mourns as well, having left Erudite after realizing their corruption. Tris tells them that the serum Erudite gave the Dauntless members is controlling them into attacking the Abnegation members; part of a plot to usurp control of government from the Abnegation faction. To stop this, they must infiltrate the Dauntless fortress. Tris leads them away.<br/><br/>Tris guides Andrew and Caleb, and another fighter, to the train that takes them to Dauntless. They jump off the train onto the rooftop and down into the hole. Tris finds Peter and forces him to tell them where the fortress is after shooting him. The heroes encounter more controlled Dauntless members. Andrew shoots at them and kills them, but he is shot and also dies quickly. Caleb cries over his father, and Tris briefly mourns him as well. She continues moving until she finds the room with Jeanine and others, ready to complete the controlling of the Dauntless. all ready to kill many of the Abnegation members. Some of the Dauntless have already begun killing some Abnegation members off. Tris sees that Four has also been injected with the serum, controlling him to attack Tris. She fights back, but Four outfights her easily. Tris repeatedly tries to remind him who she is. She grabs a gun and points it at him, but then she turns it around to her own head. She continues to reassure Four, \"It\\'s okay, I love you.\" As Four takes hold of the handle of the gun, ready to kill Tris, she gently keeps his face turned toward her. This helps Four to fight back against the serum and throw off its effects. Four helps Tris fight off the villains. Jeanine tries to finish the process, but Tris throws a knife that pierces Jeanine\\'s hand. Tris orders her to stop the process, and Jeanine refuses, saying she\\'s willing to die for her cause. Four grabs a gun with a vial of the serum and puts it together. Jeanine snarls, \"Guess you\\'re not as Dauntless as you thought.\" Tris replies, \"You\\'re right. I\\'m Divergent.\" Four throws her the gun and she injects Jeanine with the suggestion serum, forcing her to release the Dauntless members from their control and then wipe the computer, erasing the program. After recovering from the serum and realizing what she\\'d been forced to do, Jeanine tries to attack Tris with her knife, but Tris knocks her out cold.<br/><br/>Four reunites with Marcus, his father, and he is obviously uneasy. Despite this, both Marcus and Caleb join Tris and Four as they board the train heading out of Dauntless. Tris is sad over the loss of her parents and she still doesn\\'t know where she belongs. Four says he does know.<br/><br/>Tris narrates again, saying that they feel like the factionless, having lost their homes and loved ones. However, they will continue to fight if they must.<br/><br/>The film concludes as the train takes them outside the city wall to Amity.</div></div>'}\n",

The Resistance sends a reprogrammed T-850 model 101 Terminator (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000216/?ref_=ttpl\">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>) back in time to protect the T-X\\'s targets, including Kate Brewster (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000132/?ref_=ttpl\">Claire Danes</a>) and Connor.<br/><br/>The T-X is transported into the city. It kills a woman, takes her Lexus coupe and dons her clothing. It dials in via modem to the school district database and builds a list of targets. When it is stopped by an officer (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0010264/?ref_=ttpl\">Jay Acovone</a>) for speeding, it increases its breast size and admires his Smith &amp; Wesson 4506-1 pistol.<br/><br/>Brewster and her fiancee Scott Peterson (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0266611/?ref_=ttpl\">Mark Famiglietti</a>) are in a department store adding items to their wedding gift registry. Her father, Lieutenant General Robert Brewster (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0028625/?ref_=ttpl\">David Andrews</a>) calls to tell her he won\\'t be able to visit due to computer problems at work. A worker tells General Brewster that a virus has infected half the public internet and many military applications.<br/><br/>The T-850 Terminator arrives in the desert outside LA and locates a bar open for women\\'s night. It enters and takes clothing from a male stripper. Meanwhile, John breaks into a veterinary office to obtain drugs to treat injuries he sustained in a motorcycle accident.<br/><br/>Brewster arrives at the veterinary clinic at 5:00 am to meet a customer whose cat is ill. She encounters John, disarming him due to his drug-induced weakness and locks him in a kennel cage just before the customer arrives. A few minutes later the T-X arrives, seeking Brewster. It kills the customer with the officer\\'s pistol, and finds a small piece of gauze with blood on it. When it licks it to examine the blood sample, it immediately identifies John himself. Kate Brewster manages to escape to the parking lot where the T-X intercepts her. It holds a boot on Kate\\'s neck, demanding Connor\\'s location. The Terminator arrives and interrupts the interrogation by smashing the T-X into a concrete block building at high speed with a truck. The Terminator learns Connor\\'s location from Brewster, locks her in the back of her truck, and then finds Connor. When the T-X rises from the mass of concrete debris, The Terminator instructs Connor to run, and moves forward to intercept the T-X.<br/><br/>Connor gets in Brewster\\'s truck and drives away at high speed. In a fight with the Terminator, the T-X discharges a plasma weapon that disables the Terminator. The T-X then injects several nearby emergency vehicles with nano-machines and dispatches them in pursuit of Connor in Brewster\\'s truck. The T-X walks by the police and emergency responders unnoticed and commandeers a large mobile crane and follows after the emergency vehicles. The Terminator revives and seizes a police motorcycle from an officer and begins to chase after the T-X. During the chase, the T-X and The Terminator destroy many vehicles and buildings. The Terminator finally ejects the T-X from the cab but the T-X catches hold of the truck by the rear bumper. The Transformer drops the crane hook into a manhole, engaging the cable and jumps to Brewster\\'s truck. As the T-X reenters the crane\\'s cab, the cable runs out and the crane and rig are flipped upside down. The T-X emerges from the wreckage unable to pursue Brewster\\'s truck any further.<br/><br/>Driving Brewster\\'s truck, the Terminator tells Connor that in the future Connor and Brewster are married, and that it successfully killed Connor in 2032. Brewster then captured the Terminator and reprogrammed it to return to the past and protect them.<br/><br/>The Terminator saves Connor and Brewster from the T-X\\'s attack, and the three visit the mausoleum where Sarah Connor is buried, after she died of leukemia 10 years ago. Inside the casket they find a weapons cache left by Sarah\\'s friends as stipulated in her will, a backup in case Judgment Day was not averted. The T-X, impersonating Brewster\\'s boyfriend, arrives shortly after the police and a battle ensues, but Connor and the Terminator steal a hearse and escape. They rescue Brewster from the T-X as it transforms from her fiancee back into a female shape, deterring it temporarily by hitting it with a rocket-propelled-grenade. A short distance away, the T-X pursues them on foot, cutting through the roof of the hearse, before they drive under a semi-truck trailer which scrapes off the roof and leaving the T-X behind. The Terminator has been programmed to take Connor and Brewster to a safe location so that they will survive Judgment Day, set to occur in a few hours. The Terminator tells John and Kate that Kate\\'s father is also on the T-X\\'s list of targets. After the destruction of Cyberdyne Systems (in Terminator 2: Judgment Day), the United States Air Force took over the Skynet project and renamed it CRS, Cyber Research Systems. The project is headed by Kate\\'s father. When John insists that they attempt to prevent Skynet from being activated, the Terminator refuses, saying he\\'s not programmed to follow John\\'s orders. Kate insists that the Terminator aide them in rescuing her father and the Terminator complies, saying it\\'s programmed to follow her direction.<br/><br/>At his command base, Kate\\'s father is dealing with early indications of serious problems with the public cell, communications, Internet, and satellite transmissions, apparently in the form of a virus. T-X enters the secure facility disguised as a female airman unchecked by any security. She finds, activates and assumes control of several T1-2 cyborg hunter-killers.<br/><br/>The Terminator, Brewster, and Connor enter the secure CRS facility unopposed and arrive in the master control room too late to prevent her father and the military from activating Skynet. Brewster is ordered by his superiors to activate Skynet so it can eradicate the virus that has now infected the public network, satellite communications, and taken away their control of the military network.<br/><br/>When Brewster activates Skynet, it assumes control of the military\\'s network, Minuteman missile system, and submarine missile systems, interrupting the human\\'s control of the system just as the T-X arrives. The T-X in the form of Brewster\\'s daughter enters the control room and is temporarily interrupted in its attempt to kill General Brewster by The Terminator, who shoots it with a machine gun. Before it can be stopped however it rises, transformed into its female shape. and shoots General Brewster, mortally wounding him. The Terminator repulses the T-X attack, firing repeated rounds from a Sage Control SL-6 Rotary Launcher, sending it down an elevator shaft. Connor asks the dying General for the supposed location of Skynet\\'s system core. The General takes them to his office where the access codes are located in his safe. En route they are attacked by two T1-2 cyborgs which The Terminator defeats by detaching one unit\\'s head and using its own GE M134 Minigun against the other unit.<br/><br/>General Brewster tells Conner to go to Crystal Peak, a hardened military base in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The Terminator fights the T-X and tells Brewster and Connor to get to his plane on the nearby runway. The T-X and The Terminator fight until the T-X defeats The Terminator, after which she injects him with nano-machines. As Connor and Brewster escape, they follow a particle accelerator towards the runway but they are attacked by a small hunter-killer. Brewster suddenly seizes a AKMS Assault rifle and destroys one of the robots -- John remarks that she suddenly reminds him of his mother. En route to the aircraft runway, the T-X attacks them. Connor turns on the particle accelerator and its massive electromagnetic energy attracts the T-X so strongly it cannot remove itself.<br/><br/>The Terminator reboots and reattaches its head, partially detached by the T-X. In the particle accelerator loop, the T-X appears to be disintegrating but manages to engage a electric saw and begin to cut through the accelerator shielding.<br/><br/>In the airplane hanger, Connor and Brewster attempt to board the light aircraft, but The Terminator attacks them, powerless to stop itself because of the T-X\\'s injected nano-machines. Connor reminds him of his primary mission, to protect Connor and Brewster. The Terminator is able to override the T-X\\'s programming and shuts itself down before it kills Connor.<br/><br/>Connor and Brewster fly to Crystal Peak, however shortly after they arrive the are attacked by the T-X who crash-lands a helicopter into the base\\'s entrance tunnel. As they frantically try to open the blast doors, The Terminator, which had rebooted it\\'s core functions, crash-lands a second, larger helicopter and smashes the T-X under its wreckage. Even with its legs severed the T-X continues to pursue Connor and Brewster, but the Terminator traps it under a blast door and detonates its last remaining hydrogen fuel cell in the T-X\\'s mouth, the Terminator then coldly tells the T-X \"You are Terminated\", before the fuel cell explodes, destroying both of them.<br/><br/>Connor and Brewster prepare to detonate the C-4 they have brought with them only to discover that Crystal Peak does not house Skynet\\'s core, but is rather a Cold War-era fallout shelter for high-ranking government officials; General Brewster sent them there to protect them from the impending nuclear holocaust initiated by Skynet.<br/><br/>John remarks in voiceover that Skynet did not have a core but is distributed software that is located in the cloud on multiple networks and computers all over the world, allowing for redundancy and failure of independent programs, making it effectively impossible to shut down. Skynet begins a series of nuclear attacks on cities across the world, commencing Judgment Day. Soon after the attacks the communications equipment at Crystal Peak picks up transmissions from amateur radio operators and Montana\\'s civil defense, to which Connor responds as the person in charge.</div></div>'}\n",

Fearing his powers put him at risk, Sonic\\'s guardian, a wise owl named Longclaw, helps him escape to the planet Earth, advising him to stay hidden. Sonic later arrives in the small town of Green Hills, Montana. One night, he accidentally releases a power surge that causes a massive blackout. Baffled by this, the U.S. government hires the nefariously insane but ingenious scientist Dr. Ivo Robotnik to find out what caused the blackout. They soon discover Sonic and his incredible superpowers. Robotnik wants to capture Sonic in hopes of using his powers to improve his army of evil drones and robots. Sonic turns to local police officer Tom Wachowski for help hiding from Robotnik and the U.S. military. Now, Sonic and Tom are on an action-packed road trip to find the rings that would allow Sonic to leave Earth and ruin Dr. Robotnik\\'s evil plan.</div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">In San Francisco, California, a seemingly normal day is interrupted by a shocking spectacle: an anthropomorphic hedgehog with blue fur, white gloves and red shoes is running through the city at breathtaking speed while a flying machine piloted by a mustached scientist dressed in red gives chase and fires explosive energy blasts!<br/><br/>In the middle of the chase, there is a pause as the hedgehog, named Sonic, begins to narrate what is currently happening and rewinds to the very beginning.<br/><br/>Sonic recalls his childhood days living on a beautiful island with palm trees, waterfalls, and even loop-de-loops made of earth. He recalls running joyously across the island every day, relishing in life and making full, open use of his natural-born powers despite being told to keep them secret.<br/><br/>The toddler Sonic rushes home to the treehouse where his doting surrogate mother, Longclaw the Owl is resting, and playfully bumps into her to wake her up. Longclaw warns Sonic that he might have been noticed because of his coveted powers, and sure enough, as Sonic affectionately presents a sunflower to her, they are ambushed by a tribe of echidna archers. Longclaw desperately flies away with Sonic, only for one of the echidnas to fire his arrow and successfully strike her, causing her to plummet to the ground with Sonic still clinging to her. Though injured, Longclaw reminds Sonic of the importance of keeping himself and his powers hidden, and uses a golden ring to open a portal to a world on the far side of the universe, called Earth. She gives the rest of the rings to Sonic in a small bag and tells him to flee to Earth, where he will be safe. The reluctant Sonic runs through the portal while Longclaw stays behind to hold off the approaching echidnas. Seeing her in danger, Sonic desperately runs back to try to save her, but the portal closes just before he can reach her, leaving Sonic heartbroken and alone.<br/><br/>Ten years later, Sonic has adjusted to life on Earth. Tom Wachowski, the local sheriff of Green Hills, Montana, is sitting bored in the empty speed trap, waiting for cars, and Sonic playfully messes with him by zipping past his radar gun at ridiculous speeds. Tom discovers one of Sonic\\'s blue quills lying in the long grass and brings it with him as he is called away by his deputy, Wade to address a minor issue. Sonic saves a turtle from being run over by an approaching car and takes the excited reptile for a wild ride before leaving it and zipping back to his hidden cave of a makeshift home. Sonic seems to love his life, since he has great fun with the discarded items he uses to occupy himself, and feels safe since he knows what to do if he is ever discovered. Should he ever be found, he\\'ll escape to one of the worlds depicted on a map included in the bag of rings; an uninhabited world full of giant mushrooms. He hates the idea, but he is not worried, since Green Hills feels like a home to him. He frequents the town every day and secretly observes the people, his favorite of whom is Tom (or \"Donut Lord,\" as he calls him). He also likes Tom\\'s veterinarian wife Maddie, whom he nicknames \"Pretzel Lady\" for her yoga flexibility. He also likes to mess with old, eccentric Crazy Carl, the only person in town who actually knows about him and who is constantly trying in vain to catch him. Having formed a strong bond with Tom and Maddie from afar, Sonic often hangs out around their house, especially on movie nights. But even with this fun place and all of these so-called \"friends\" of his, Sonic still feels very lonely in his self-imposed isolation.<br/><br/>After coming home one night to find raccoons in his trash can, Tom receives from Maddie his long-awaited letter of acceptance into the San Francisco Police Department, and the two discuss the difficult decision to move away from Green Hills. The next day, as Tom recites his departure speech to a donut, Sonic observes the local youth baseball playoffs. That night, Sonic goes into the vacant baseball field and plays by himself, using his speed to assume the roles of all the players. He manages to make a perfect play and rejoices, but when he looks around and sees that no one is there to cheer him on, he realizes he is truly alone forever. In his despair, he tries to work off the pain by running desperately around the field, until the energy emitting from his body generates a massive electromagnetic pulse that knocks out power across the entire Pacific Northwest. With the entire town in the dark, the panicking Wade contacts Tom, who gives him instructions but ends the call prematurely when he sees the quill he discovered earlier glowing with electric, blue light.<br/><br/>News of the event soon reaches the Pentagon, and the baffled Department of Defense enlists the help of brilliant roboticist and scientific genius, Dr. Robotnik to discover the cause. After Robotnik and his partner, Agent Stone take charge of the military detachment stationed at the baseball field, Robotnik\\'s flying, high-tech, egg-shaped drones head into the forest and discover one of Sonic\\'s footprints. Robotnik discovers that his computer can\\'t find a single match in Earth\\'s animal kingdom to identify the creature responsible for the print. As the military troops and the drones search the forest for Sonic, Sonic rushes back to his cave to collect his valuables and prepares to leave Earth forever. But just before he can use the rings, the troops and drones draw close to his cave and Sonic flees to avoid them, sentimentally bidding goodbye to his cave.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Tom is on the phone with Maddie, who has flown out to San Francisco to visit her sister, Rachel and niece, Jojo. As Tom tells Maddie about the blackout, he hears a disturbance and sees his trash can toppled over. Thinking the raccoons are back, Tom takes Maddie\\'s tranquilizer gun and goes out to investigate the shed. Inside the shed, Sonic prepares to use his ring, but just before he can, Tom bursts into the shed and sees him. Both of them scream in terror at the sight of each other, and Tom fires a dart into Sonic\\'s leg. The weakening Sonic sees a picture of San Francisco\\'s Transamerica Pyramid on Tom\\'s T-shirt, and as he drops his ring, it opens a portal above the actual building itself. Sonic accidentally drops the bag of rings into the portal, and it lands on the building\\'s roof. The portal thusly closes as Sonic passes out, and Tom brings Sonic inside, placing him in a dog cage.<br/><br/>Tom examines Sonic and realizes he is Crazy Carl\\'s \"Blue Devil.\" Sonic awakens and climbs out of the cage, and the two finally meet for real just as Robotnik\\'s truck arrives. Sonic begs for Tom\\'s help and Tom hides Sonic in the attic as he goes out to meet Robotnik, who dispatches his drones to search the house while the two talk outside. Sonic hides from the drones and curls up into a ball to hide among the various sports balls stored in the attic, but when the drones get too close, Sonic flees the attic and causes a noise. Robotnik barges into the house to find only a raccoon eating a cake that Maddie baked for Tom. As he turns to leave, however, he discovers the quill. As Robotnik threatens Tom to reveal where Sonic is, Sonic shows himself and begs Robotnik to spare Tom, eliciting a terrified scream from Robotnik. Seizing the opportunity, Tom punches Robotnik and knocks him out cold, and after a battle in the house with one of Robotnik\\'s drones, Tom and Sonic escape the house. Agent Stone arrives to check on Robotnik, who berates Stone for not trying to stop the fugitives and tells him to bring the quill.<br/><br/>With Tom and Sonic now on the run, Tom asks Sonic to explain himself, and Sonic says that he needs to get to San Francisco so he can get back his lost rings. At first, Tom tells Sonic to go himself, but Sonic doesn\\'t know where San Francisco is, and following Tom\\'s directions to simply head west only causes him to crash straight into the Pacific and run back to Tom wet, cold, covered in seaweed, and wearing a fish. Sonic blames Tom for his fate and insists he can\\'t accomplish his goal alone. Reluctantly, Tom agrees to take Sonic with him to San Francisco.<br/><br/>As the two begin their travels, Sonic treats the journey as a fun road trip, admiring the attractions along the way, such as the world\\'s largest rubber band ball. That night, they stop in a certain section of town and Tom tells Sonic to stay in the car as he uses a nearby payphone to call Wade, who reveals that Robotnik and his agents are searching for Tom, and are with him in the station. Furious at having been punched in the face, Robotnik warns Tom that he is coming for him. Meanwhile, Sonic tries desperately to control his excitement over an extremely entertaining-looking biker bar, but eventually caves in. Tom comes back to his car with a purchased meal, only to find Sonic missing. He finds Sonic in the bar and Sonic persuades him to stay and have fun with him. Sonic compiles a \"bucket list\" of the things he\\'d like to do on Earth, but becomes sad when he realizes he might not be able to do them since he has to leave Earth soon. But Tom encourages Sonic to try to do as much as he can right where they are, and the two take a while to enjoy themselves with all the bar\\'s activities. Unfortunately, a group of rough-looking punks come looking for trouble and Sonic aggravates their leader, starting a bar fight. The leader of the punks attacks Sonic, but Sonic speeds up his awareness and runs around the bar, saving Tom from attackers and setting up sassy pranks and traps to end the fight, all in the span of the single moment before the punk leader can reach him. The fight is ended abruptly by Sonic\\'s devices and the punk leader crashes through the window wearing a wall-mounted bear head. Tom and Sonic flee the bar, outrunning the angry patrons, and spend the night in a local motel.<br/><br/>After Sonic runs around the room enjoying himself with various activities, Tom asks him about this other planet to which he must go when he leaves Earth. Sonic reveals that it\\'s a very unenviable place and wonders aloud about whether Longclaw might have been wrong. He ponders having a life on Earth and soon falls asleep. As Tom tucks him in, he sees that one of the items on Sonic\\'s bucket list is to \"make a real friend.\" At that moment, the news report features a warning about Tom, who has been declared a domestic terrorist because of his actions in protecting Sonic from Robotnik and the military.<br/><br/>The next morning, Robotnik and Stone interrogate the bar patrons, including the punk leader, learning that Tom and Sonic are heading to San Francisco. Robotnik triangulates their location and gives chase. On the road, Sonic asks Tom about what he would have on his own bucket list. Tom reveals his intentions to leave Green Hills to become a San Francisco street cop and prove himself as a hero, but Sonic is baffled by the fact that Tom would want to leave such a perfect town and all the people he cares about. Robotnik finds them and sends out a battle machine called Mayhem. A battle on the road ensues, with Tom and Sonic defeating each of the machine\\'s smaller phases, though the car is badly damaged in the fight. Eventually, Sonic finds himself with a bomb stuck to his hand, and they pull off the road to get rid of it. But just when Sonic manages to get it off, it explodes, knocking Sonic out cold.<br/><br/>Tom is relieved to find that Sonic is alive, but Robotnik is enraged, and berates Stone for sympathizing with them. At that moment, however, Robotnik finds that the quill in Stone\\'s pocket is glowing with blue, electric light.<br/><br/>Finally reaching San Francisco, Tom rushes to Maddie\\'s house, only to be greeted by a fiercely antagonistic Rachel, who has seen the news reports on him and refuses to let him in until Maddie intervenes. Jojo and Tom\\'s dog, Ozzy come to greet him, and as Rachel and Maddie argue about Tom, Ozzy pulls away the towel in which Tom has wrapped Sonic, revealing him. Rachel faints at the sight and Maddie and Jojo just stare.<br/><br/>Robotnik, meanwhile, analyzes the quill and the energy it contains whilst amusing himself by dancing to a tune, until he is startled half to death by the sudden appearance of Agent Stone, who has come to offer a latte. At that moment, the machine finishes analyzing the quill, revealing it to contain unlimited energy, which Robotnik believes can enable his machines to reach their full potential.<br/><br/>Tom and Maddie tend to the injured Sonic, while Rachel sits bound in a chair. Maddie uses smelling salts to awaken Sonic, who zips around the room at breathtaking speed before frantically coming to grips with his surroundings and enthusiastically greeting Pretzel Lady. The terrified Maddie asks Tom who and what Sonic is, and Tom reveals the truth of their adventures together and Sonic\\'s intent to reach the Transamerica Pyramid. Jojo brings Sonic a new pair of bright, red shoes, to which he takes an instant liking. Sonic also meets Ozzy, of whom he is jealous, but from whom he enjoys an affectionate face-licking.<br/><br/>Tom and Maddie borrow the indignant Rachel\\'s car and head with Sonic to the Transamerica Pyramid, where Tom uses the false pretense of saving a jumper to gain the needed clearance to travel to the roof. Tom and Maddie carry Sonic inside a bag, eliciting grave concern from onlookers who believe that the pair are carrying an abducted child. The three finally reach the roof, where Sonic at last finds and retrieves his bag of rings. After an emotional goodbye between Sonic and Tom, Sonic attempts to throw a ring to open the portal, but it bounces off of one of Robotnik\\'s drones. Many more drones surround the three and Robotnik himself appears in his own flying craft to meet them. After a brief exchange between Robotnik and Tom, Sonic taunts Robotnik by calling him \"Eggman\" after his egg-shaped drones. Robotnik readies his drones to blow the three away, but Sonic pushes Tom and Maddie off the top of the building. Robotnik fires his missiles at Sonic, who speeds up his awareness to avoid them and casually pushes them aside. But Robotnik is able to press a button that charges his vehicle with energy from the quill, and achieves supersonic speed. He fires a blast which Sonic only narrowly avoids, and which knocks him into momentary delirium. Sonic awakes to find Tom and Maddie still falling. He grabs one of the rings falling with him and throws it, opening a portal beneath them that transports the two back to Green Hills. Tom and Maddie end up in a farmer\\'s barn, while back in San Francisco, Sonic lands in a tree before crashing to the ground, along with the rest of the rings and Robotnik\\'s destroyed drones. Meanwhile, the owner of the barn greets Tom and Maddie, asking for their help in aiding a cow\\'s effort to give birth.<br/><br/>Robotnik corners Sonic and taunts him, but Sonic gathers up his spilled rings and runs through the city as Robotnik gives chase in his vehicle. Narrating again, Sonic notes how this has brought the film full circle, and earnestly continues the story, wanting to know what happens next just as much as the audience. Robotnik chases Sonic through San Francisco, and Sonic is shocked by Robotnik\\'s ability to keep up with him. Sonic opens a portal to France, with him and Robotnik disrupting a mime act being performed for a young girl as they rush past. Sonic\\'s next ring portal brings him and Robotnik to China, where Robotnik chases Sonic along the Great Wall. Next, Sonic opens a portal to Egypt, where Robotnik destroys many centuries-old monuments in his zeal to catch Sonic. Sonic uses his speed to create a sand whirlwind that temporarily disrupts Robotnik\\'s visual contact, but Robotnik sees Sonic running up the side of one of the Great Pyramids and follows him to the top, firing a blast just as Sonic manages to open another portal ring.<br/><br/>The portal brings Sonic back to Green Hills, now at night, but the blast sends him hurtling through the ring and into the street, where he lays motionless. Robotnik\\'s vehicle emerges through the portal and the terrified onlookers flee. Robotnik prepares to kill Sonic, but Tom engages him in physical combat inside the open cockpit of his vehicle. Unfortunately, Tom is knocked out of the cockpit and Robotnik questions why Tom would be willing to throw his life away for a \"silly little alien.\" The locals come to defend Tom, but Sonic remains motionless and silent. Robotnik suggests putting the body on ice to keep it fresh and remarks that Sonic was just an alien who didn\\'t belong. Tom responds by telling Robotnik that Sonic knew more about being human than he ever will, proclaiming him to have been his friend, which wakes Sonic up from his wounded daze. Fueled by passion, Sonic charges up with incredible energy and boldly proclaims to Robotnik that he will no longer run away, but use the power which is rightfully his to protect his friends. Robotnik pulls down his goggles and the two opponents prepare to meet in full-on battle. Robotnik fires his missiles, but Sonic avoids them and bounces off the buildings to strike Robotnik\\'s vehicle with an increasingly rapid barrage of body-slams. With the vehicle severely damaged, but still afloat, Sonic calls for Tom to open a portal to the mushroom planet behind Robotnik. Then, at last, Sonic dashes straight at Robotnik\\'s vehicle and strikes it with enough force to send it flying backwards through the portal to the mushroom planet just as the portal closes.<br/><br/>Tom and Sonic reunite and Tom gives Sonic back his rings, as well as a high-five: a gift desired by Sonic ever since his having seen a young baseball batter high-five his teammates. Tom tells Maddie that he has decided not to leave Green Hills, feeling that he has already saved a life. As the crowd disperses, Sonic follows Tom and Maddie.<br/><br/>The next day, as Tom and Maddie are repairing and repainting their house, one of the officials from the Pentagon comes to thank Tom for defeating Robotnik, and to inform him that his guilt has been erased, along with all records of Robotnik\\'s existence. As a bonus, he presents Tom with an Olive Garden gift card and asks if Sonic might be willing to talk to the President, but Tom falsely claims that Sonic has left so as to spare him that. After the official leaves, Sonic asks if they\\'d like to see a movie, but Maddie tells him that it\\'s time to go back to his cave. However, when Sonic tries to go, they tell him that they meant something else. Opening the attic door, Tom and Maddie show Sonic his new room, which he is astonished to find contains all of his belongings. Overcome with joy, Sonic runs around and relishes in having his things back. Tom and Maddie sit with Sonic on the bed and welcome him home, and Sonic gives them heartfelt thanks. As the view zooms out and away from the house, Ozzy comes to lick Sonic again, with Sonic still jealous but enjoying the licking.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, on the mushroom planet, Robotnik has completely lost his sanity. As he finishes shaving himself totally bald, he gazes at his reflection in a pool of water, now with an extremely long, grown-out mustache that looks completely zany. Talking to a rock that he has carved to resemble Agent Stone, he throws it and tells it to perform \"rock-connaissance\" for him. He reflects on his situation and remarks that a lesser man would die in such a place. But then, he holds up a small container with the quill inside it, and says that he\\'ll be home by Christmas. Pulling down his goggles, he walks like a robot until he finds the stone, which he throws again as he yells out \"rock-connaissance\" once more and laughs maniacally.<br/><br/>A mid-credits scene shows forested hills, and on one hill, the leaves stir as a ring portal opens. From it emerges a young, orange fox with two tails, who uses a small handheld device to determine from the present levels of energy whether Sonic might be near. Finding the readings to be sufficient, the young fox hopes aloud that he is not too late to find him and uses his twin tails like helicopter blades to take off flying into the vast forest.</div></div>'}\n",

Alpha-Omega employs other apes formerly loyal to Koba, derogatorily called \"donkeys\". An Alpha-Omega platoon launches an attack on an ape outpost, but it fails and four soldiers, including one named Preacher and a \"donkey\" gorilla named Red, are captured. Caesar releases the soldiers, hoping the display of mercy will show the Colonel that the apes are not savages; Red escapes by injuring the albino gorilla Winter. Later, Caesar\\'s eldest son Blue Eyes and lieutenant Rocket return from a long journey. Blue Eyes reports that they found a place across the desert that is ideal for the apes. Despite an uneasy Winter asserting that the apes should leave immediately, Caesar decides they need to prepare first. That night, the Colonel leads a team of soldiers in infiltrating the apes\\' home, killing Blue Eyes and Caesar\\'s wife Cornelia; Caesar unsuccessfully attempts to prevent the Colonel\\'s escape. Afterward, the apes are unable to find Winter, who they believe betrayed them out of fear.</div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">In this third version of the Planet of the Apes film, it has been 15 years since the ALZ-113 virus - also known by the human survivors as as the Simian Flu - spread across the globe killing billions of people (Rise of the Planet of the Apes), leading to a rise of intelligent apes. Their leader, the chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis), had tried to maintain peace between the apes and humans, until the chip Koba (Toby Kebbell) betrayed the apes and brought on the dawn of a new conflict (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes). Now, Caesar and his clan are hiding out in a command base in the Muir Woods while a ruthless Special Forces Colonel of the military faction Alpha-Omega is out to get them. The humans and apes are now caught up in all-out war.<br/><br/>A team of soldiers quietly move through the woods to locate the apes. They are being helped by an ape named Red (Ty Olsson), whom the soldiers refer to as \"Donkey\". Red and another ape loyal to Koba look out for the command base. The soldiers launch their attack on the base by opening fire, but the apes retaliate with great force, hurling spears and shooting at soldiers as they ride on horses. Red, along with several surviving soldiers, are captured. Caesar decides to spare them and send them back to their camp unharmed to send the message that the apes are peaceful. Red, meanwhile, escapes from the hold of Winter (Aleks Paunovic) and runs back to the camp.<br/><br/>Caesar\\'s son Blue Eyes (Max Lloyd-Jones) returns home to his family and his mate Lake (Sara Canning). Caesar rejoins his wife Cornelia (Judy Greer) and youngest son Cornelius (Devyn Dalton). Caesar and his friends discuss a plan to move the clan away from the woods and toward a new home.<br/><br/>That night as the apes are asleep, several Alpha-Omega soldiers, led by Colonel McCullough (Woody Harrelson), stalk the command base. The soldiers are killed, but McCullough shoots and kills Cornelia and Blue Eyes, having intended to kill Caesar. Caesar finds his family dead and leaps after McCullough as he gets away through the waterfall. McCullough then severs the rope and lets Caesar fall.<br/><br/>Caesar returns to his base and has the other apes search for Cornelius. Thankfully, Caesar finds him safe. He places his son in Lake\\'s care as he heads off to find McCullough while the rest of the apes head toward the desert in search of their new home. Caesar is followed by orangutan Maurice (Karin Konoval), chimp Rocket (Terry Notary), and gorilla Luca (Michael Adamthwaite). Caesar refuses to allow them to join him, but they insist as they want to protect their leader.<br/><br/>The apes continue heading forward. They encounter a lone man who attempts to shoot them, but Caesar kills him first. They enter his home and find a little girl - later named Nova - (Amiah Miller) lying in bed. Although she appears frightened, Maurice gently hands her a doll. Nova tries to speak but is unable to. The apes proceed to continue their journey, but Nova steps out and sees the dead man (he was possibly her father). Despite Caesar saying they cannot take her, Maurice says he cannot leave her there either.<br/><br/>The four apes come across a military camp. They find Winter, who has defected to the humans\\' side after Red promised he would be spared if Winter let him go, which lead Red to tell McCullough where to find the apes. Caesar interrogates Winter and learns that McCullough and his army are talking about heading toward a border. The apes then see that the humans are close. Caesar puts his hand over Winter\\'s mouth to keep him quiet, and he ends up leaving him unconscious.<br/><br/>At night, Caesar has a nightmare about Koba, who appears bloody and more scarred than before. He repeats to Caesar his final words - \"Ape not kill ape.\"<br/><br/>The apes and Nova pass through the snowy mountains. They find the bodies of three soldiers shot in the snow. One of them is still alive but is slowly dying. Caesar asks him why he was shot, but the soldier cannot speak just like Nova. Maurice points out that the man will die of his wounds, so Caesar puts him out of his misery.<br/><br/>As the apes are looking around the area, a small creature in a jacket steals a rifle and one of the horses. The apes chase after the creature until they corner it in an abandoned building. It is a small ape, known as Bad Ape (Steve Zahn). He offers his jacket to Nova, seeing that she is cold. Bad Ape is capable of speech like Caesar. He tells Caesar that he lived in a zoo before the Simian Flu struck, and he got his name from what the humans always yelled at him. Bad Ape gives the group food that is labeled \"California Border\". Caesar asks where the food came from, and Bad Ape says it came from a \"human zoo\" (quarantine camp).<br/><br/>Once the apes reach the military camp, they are attacked by a soldier. Luca kills the solider but is also mortally wounded in the process. Luca tells Caesar that at least he was able to protect him this time. Even Nova cries for Luca as he had shown her kindness before. Caesar tells the others that this is why he wanted to come alone. Maurice tells Caesar that his hatred for the Colonel is making him like Koba.<br/><br/>Caesar heads toward the camp at night by himself, only to find two captured apes hung up on a mountain overlooking the camp. One ape tells Caesar that the ape clan has been captured and are being forced to work. Red then appears behind Caesar and knocks him out with the butt of his rifle.<br/><br/>Caesar wakes up to find himself face-to-face with McCullough. Caesar tells him he came for him after he killed Caesar\\'s family. McCullough gives an insincere apology and says he meant to kill Caesar.<br/><br/>Caesar is put to work with the rest of his captured apes. He sees Lake and Cornelius in a separate cage, with the little ape helplessly calling out for his father. The apes are then forced to work to build a wall, despite being starved and dehydrated. One ape is then whipped by Red, with Caesar yelling at him to stop. Caesar is whipped in his place. McCullough demands that Caesar tell the apes to continue working even as Caesar pleads for him to give them food and water. McCullough kills one ape and prepares to kill more, but Lake and the other apes continue to work for Caesar\\'s sake.<br/><br/>Red and a soldier called Preacher (Gabriel Chavarria) escort Caesar to McCullough\\'s office in chains. Caesar once again tells the Colonel to give the apes food and water. He tells McCullough that he has no mercy. The Colonel verbally hits back that Caesar had shown up with the intention to kill him, but Caesar responds that he did show mercy by sparing his soldiers. McCullough then tells Caesar about his son, who was a soldier in his army until he was affected by the Simian Flu and began to lose his voice, along with other soldiers. McCullough killed his son and those soldiers as he knew they were regressing into a primitive state. He then explains that the wall is meant for another military force that is coming for him to put an end to his radicalized faction.<br/><br/>The captured apes are finally given food and water, except for Caesar. He has another hallucination of Koba, who tells Caesar to join him. Meanwhile in the distance, Maurice, Rocket, Bad Ape, and Nova are seeing what\\'s going on in the camp. Nova walks into the camp and approaches Caesar\\'s cage. She gives him food and water, as well as the doll that Maurice gave her. The soldiers are approaching, and, fearing that they will kill Nova, Rocket steps in as a distraction to allow her to get away. The soldiers capture Rocket and McCullough picks up Nova\\'s doll, which is now stained with blood.<br/><br/>Maurice and Bad Ape find a way to sneak into the camp via an underground tunnel. They proceed to dig through but stop when they hit a water source, fearing it will flood the tunnel. They manage to seal off that part to prevent the flooding.<br/><br/>Caesar and Rocket work together to find a way to make it to the other cage to save the ape children while Maurice and Bad Ape dig their way to the camp. Rocket creates a diversion by flinging poo at one of the guards before Bad Ape pulls him underground. The apes get the children out and make it through the tunnel to get away from the camp. Caesar embraces Cornelius upon seeing him again. Before leaving, Caesar admits to Rocket that he is like Koba because he cannot let go of his hatred for the Colonel. He heads back to McCullough\\'s office to finish his mission.<br/><br/>Soon, the rival military force begins attacking the camp, launching rockets at the soldiers while they fire back. Caesar makes it to McCullough\\'s office and finds him drunk. He tries to speak but he has lost his voice too. Caesar grabs a gun, and the Colonel takes Caesar\\'s hand to hold it to his head, ready for Caesar to pull the trigger. However, Caesar cannot bring himself to do so. McCullough grabs the gun and shoots himself in the head.<br/><br/>In the midst of the chaos, the other apes have gotten away while Caesar tries to rejoin them. He grabs a grenade belt and tries to throw one at a leaking fuel tank, but he is shot with an arrow by Preacher. Red sees this as one of the soldiers is demanding a grenade launcher from him. Red turns on the humans and fires a grenade at Preacher before he finishes Caesar. Red is then shot dead after redeeming himself. Caesar grabs the grenade and finishes the job, destroying the tank and blowing up the whole facility as he gets away through the tunnel.<br/><br/>Caesar reaches the apes as the other militants cheer the fall of Alpha-Omega\\'s camp. Some soldiers spot Caesar and are prepared to shoot him until an avalanche starts coming down. Caesar and the others apes (plus Nova on Maurice\\'s back) climb up the trees to safety while the avalanche wipes out all the remaining soldiers.<br/><br/>The apes and Nova then continue on their journey to a new home until they finally reach a new land that the apes are happy with. Caesar and Maurice watch as the apes are celebrating their freedom, but Maurice notices Caesar\\'s arrow wound. Knowing that he is going to die, Caesar asks Maurice to make sure Cornelius is protected. Maurice assures him that his son will know who he was and what he did for his family. With that, Caesar passes away in peace.</div></div>'}\n",

The child\\'s desperate mind remarkably bends a metal gate until a guard knocks Lensherr unconscious (a recreation of the opening scene of the first X-Men movie). Scientist Sebastian Shaw, who has observed this incident through a window, calls Lensherr up to see him. Placing a metal coin on a desk, he orders Lensherr to use his power to move it. When Lensherr cannot, despite his best efforts, Shaw shoots and kills Lensherr\\'s mother in front of him. In his rage, Lensherr\\'s out-of-control magnetic power kills the two guards and destroys two rooms, to Shaw\\'s delight. Shaw tells Lensherr that they will \"have fun\" developing the boy\\'s power.<br/><br/>Around this same time, in a Westchester County, New York, mansion, young Charles Xavier is awoken when he thinks he hears a burglar break in. He heads down to the kitchen and finds a young, shape-shifting girl named Raven Darkhölme, disguised as his mother, who is looking through the fridge for food. Using his mind to talk to Raven, Xavier accuses his \"mother\" of being an imposter, and asks what it has done with his real mother, as she would not make him a sandwich or hot chocolate. Raven shifts back to her normal, blue-skinned form. Overjoyed to meet someone else \"different\" like him, Xavier invites her in.<br/><br/>In 1962, Lensherr goes to Switzerland and forces a banker (by ripping out one of the metal fillings in his mouth) to trace a bar of Nazi gold to Shaw\\'s address in Argentina. In a tavern there patronized by former German soldiers, Lensherr kills three men as he learns that Shaw owns a yacht in Florida. Meanwhile, in England, Xavier has graduated from Oxford and is publishing his thesis on mutation; Raven is now his foster sister and works as a waitress. Simultaneously in Las Vegas, Nevada, CIA agent Moira MacTaggart follows U.S. Army Colonel Hendry into the Hellfire Club, where she sees Shaw, Emma Frost, Riptide and Azazel. Shaw calmly threatens Hendry, telling him that the Colonel should reverse his position on advocating that the U.S. install nuclear missiles in Turkey, a move the government had previously avoided so as not to provoke war with the Soviet Union. When Hendry refuses, Shaw has Riptide demonstrate his power to conjure tornadoes from thin air and hurls Hendry into a wall. Convinced, Shaw has Azazel teleport Hendry to the President\\'s War Room, where he supports the missile placement in Turkey.<br/><br/>Shaw later meets with Colonel Hendry on his yacht, and refuses to give Hendry his money, at which point Hendry pulls out a grenade and threatens to pull the pin and kill himself and everyone on the boat\\'s deck. Shaw takes the grenade and pulls the pin himself, and absorbs the blast -- Shaw is a mutant, and absorbs energy, which also keeps him young, then taps Hendry, expelling the grenade\\'s energy into the Colonel, destroying him.<br/><br/>MacTaggart seeks Xavier\\'s advice on mutation, and takes Xavier and Raven to the CIA to convince the chief that Shaw is a threat. After convincing them that mutants exist, they are to be taken to a covert facility, but first Xavier insists they track down Shaw. Shaw is aboard his yacht relaxing with Frost and Riptide when Lensherr appears. Frost uses her telepathy to pacify Erik and pushes him overboard.<br/><br/>Lensherr attacks Shaw, using the anchors and chains of the yacht to tear the boat apart. When Shaw escapes in a submarine hidden below the upper decks of the boat, Lensherr tries to stop him, his ability to control metal pulling him along in the water. Xavier stops him so that he does not drown, speaking to him telepathically and telling him it\\'s useless to follow Shaw. Lensherr joins Xavier and Raven at the CIA facility, where they meet Hank McCoy, another mutant that Xavier accidentally outs. McCoy and Xavier use a prototype Cerebro to locate mutants and recruit several of them to train to stop Shaw. During the recruiting process, we also see Xavier and Lensherr trying to talk to Logan (Wolverine) in a bar. He promptly tells them to go to hell, and they walk off.<br/><br/>Shaw plans to meet with a Russian general, but sends Frost instead, who is then captured by Xavier and Lensherr. Lensherr tortures her briefly and Xavier taps into Frost\\'s mind and finds out that Shaw plans to start a nuclear war between the US and Russia in order to wipe out all normal humans. Back in the US, the CIA facility is attacked by Azazel, Riptide and Shaw, who kill all the guards and agents present. Shaw offers the new mutants to a place on his side, but most of them refuse. He recruits Angel and kills Darwin by forcing him to ingest a massive amount of energy when he tries to fight back. When Lensherr and Xavier return they all go to Xavier\\'s mansion and begin to train, though Raven is conflicted about hiding her natural form. Hank creates a vaccine that is supposed to turn his and Raven\\'s appearance normal, however, when Hank takes it there are unexpected side effects: his mutant physical features are enhanced; he now has blue skin, blue fur and is several times stronger. The newly assembled X-Men team boards a specialized SR-71 Blackbird jet modified by Hank and fly out to the Caribbean. <br/><br/>President Kennedy institutes a blockade of a Russian fleet in the Caribbean Sea. Shaw travels with the Russian fleet to ensure that the missiles get to Cuba. Xavier, MacTaggart and Lensherr fly to the blockade to stop the fleets from engaging. Wearing a special helmet given him by the Soviets that blocks out telepathic interference, Shaw uses the sub\\'s nuclear core to charge himself up. While Azazel kills the crew of the Russian missile ship, Xavier uses his powers to make a Russian officer on one of the escort ships fire a missile and destroy the cargo ship carrying the Soviet weapons before it crosses the demarcation line established by the United States.<br/><br/>With Xavier\\'s help, Lensherr pulls Shaw\\'s submarine from the water, but an attack by Riptide forces the X-jet and submarine to crash on a nearby beach. Xavier desperately tries to locate Shaw with his telepathic ability but is unable while Shaw is in the reactor room of the sub and wears his helmet. Lensherr goes after Shaw and finds him in the sub\\'s reactor room. The two battle furiously and the shielding around the chamber cracks, allowing Xavier to locate Shaw. Lensherr tries to overcome Shaw with the metal in the room but Shaw counters with his own telekinesis and pins Lensherr to the wall. Suddenly, Lensherr plucks Shaw\\'s helmet from his head with a length of cable and Xavier is able to freeze Shaw in place. Lensherr puts on the helmet to block out Xavier\\'s telepathy and admits that he agrees with everything Shaw believes about mutants and humans and how he never would have developed his power if Shaw hadn\\'t forced him to. Eric, however, is still vengeful about Shaw\\'s murder of his mother and kills Shaw by slowly forcing the coin that Shaw taunted him with as a child through his brain while Xavier screams, experiencing the act himself. Eric exits the wrecked submarine with Shaw\\'s body and announces to his fellow mutants that the humans in both fleets are their real enemies and that the mutants should band together to fight them. Xavier pleads with Eric to end the campaign but he fails.<br/><br/>The two fleets fire their missiles and shells at the mutants on the beach, but Lensherr, now fully in control of his abilities, stops the projectiles in mid-flight and then turns them on the fleet. In the ensuing fight Xavier manages to distract Lensherr, but when MacTaggart fires at Lensherr he deflects the bullets, with one striking Xavier in the lower spine. The missiles and shells all fall into the ocean or explode. Lensherr removes the bullet from Charles\\' back but, more furious than before, begins to choke MacTaggart with the chain holding her ID tags, blaming her for Xavier\\'s injury. Xavier tells Erik that Moira is not the one responsible and Erik relents, realizing he injured his friend. Erik releases Moira, who rushes to Xavier\\'s side.<br/><br/>Lensherr takes Raven, Angel, Riptide and Azazel and leaves, having convinced them that humans are their enemies. Xavier, now confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, and his fellow mutants return to the mansion, where he will open a school. He wipes MacTaggart\\'s memory. MacTaggart reports to her superiors but has nothing to tell them, knowing that Charles had erased her memory of all recent events.<br/><br/>At CIA headquarters, Emma Frost sits alone in a specialized holding cell. The door is suddenly ripped from it\\'s frame and Erik walks in, his new recruits waiting just outside. He is wearing a new uniform and a newer version of the helmet he\\'d stolen from Shaw. He tells Frost to call him \"Magneto.\"</div></div>'}\n",

The scientist is sentenced to jail by the Grand Council of the Galactic Federation. The experiment is supposed to be transported to a prison asteroid, yet manages to escape Captain Gantu, who was supposed to deliver him there.

Her dysfunctional family, consisting only of Lilo and her sister Nani, is about to be ripped apart by social worker Cobra Bubbles. Stitch as the new family member brings quite some action into all their lifes, and after a while, not even Pleakley and Dr. Jookiba can recognize their former target.

It seems impossible because.. if robots can break those laws, there\\'s nothing to stop them from taking over the world, as humans have grown to become completely dependent upon their robots.

Everybody in the world relies on a huge system of robots, which are programmed specifically to help humans and not harm them in any way. But one person does not think that robots are helpful. Chicago homicide detective Del Spooner. But one day, he received a call from the United States Robotics (USR) about a recent death of renowned robot scientist Dr. Alfred J. Laning. Spooner immediately blamed this incident on robots without justifiable reason or proof. Then, he begins his investigation on Lanning\\'s death, only to discover Sonny, a \"unique\" robot. What Spooner does not realize, is that something is about to happen. Something that is beyond even Spooner\\'s wildest dreams.<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=John%20Wiggins&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_4\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">John Wiggins</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">It\\'s the year 2035, and the society now has the help of robots. These robots follow three laws integrated into their system; 1) They cannot harm a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2)They must do whatever they\\'re told by a human being as long as such orders don\\'t conflict with law one. 3) They have to defend themselves as long as such defense doesn\\'t conflict with laws one or two. One day, the writer of the three laws, Alfred Lanning, apparently jumps out of a window at U.S. Robotics. The majority of the Chicago Police Department believe he committed suicide, but Detective Del Spooner, who hates robots, thinks he was murdered, and the number one suspect is a robot who calls himself Sonny. However, if it was Sonny, then it means he would\\'ve had to have broken the three laws. With the help of Dr. Susan Calvin, Spooner must now discover the truth before it\\'s too late.<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=Ridley%20Lavine&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_5\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Ridley Lavine</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">In 2035, anthropomorphic robots enjoy widespread use as servants for various public services. They are programmed with the Three Laws of Robotics directives: to never harm a human or let a human come to harm, to always obey humans unless this violates the First Law, and to protect its own existence unless this violates the First or Second Laws.<br/><br/>Del Spooner (Will Smith) is a Chicago police detective, who is sent to investigate the death of Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), the co-founder of U.S. Robotics (USR) and its main roboticist, who died after falling 50 stories from his office. Since his office was sealed from the inside and he was alone, his death is ruled as a suicide, but Spooner believes otherwise, since he knew Lanning personally. He also finds a small holographic projector who instructs him that the \"real question\" is why he would commit suicide.<br/><br/>With the help of robo-psychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), he interrogates employees at USR, including the other co-founder and CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood), and the supercomputer V.I.K.I. (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence) (Fiona Hogan). Spooner investigates Lanning\\'s office, and determines that a man of Lanning\\'s age could not have broken through the security window. Inside the office, he finds a copy of Hansel and Gretel, and also a prototype of a new Nestor Class 5 (NS-5) model, which flees and ignores Spooner\\'s order to stand down and even knocks his pistol out, violating both the First and the Second Law.<br/><br/>Left with no options, he and Calvin drive to the Nestor Class factory, where all the NS-5 robots are automatically made, 1,000 of them each day. Calvin checks the data logs from the last shipment and discovers that \"1,001\" NS-5\\'s were made, showing that the rogue one from the office was intentionally made. After they arrive at a large room filled with the robots, Spooner tries a hostile approach and draws his gun and orders all of them to stand down to see which one will violate the Second Law to stop him shooting it. He notices the rogue robot slightly moving in the line, and chases the robot, who subdues him. The robot tries to escape, but the Chicago SWAT team subdues it.<br/><br/>The robot refuses to respond, but it insists that they call it \"Sonny\" (voiced by Alan Tudyk), and when Spooner provokes him, he shows anger, sentience and the ability to dream, traits impossible for a robot to even show, which puzzles Spooner and makes him question the robot\\'s true nature. Lt. John Bergin (Chi McBride) debriefs Spooner and recommends he drop the case because Robertson wants the robot back at the USR headquarters for demolition, but this only serves to pique Spooner\\'s interest more about Lanning\\'s death and the robot.<br/><br/>Spooner, wanting to find more information about Lanning\\'s past with USR, goes to his house, where he finds a decommission robot which is scheduled to demolish the house at 8 AM next morning. He investigates the house, finding a recording of Lanning, who states that there are possible \"ghosts in the machines\", claiming that robots could evolve to develop sentience, and declares that one day, robots will have \"secrets\" and \"dreams\". As he investigates the house, he notices a sensor strip, the same one as in the USR building, and suddenly, the robot changes the schedule from 8 AM to 8 PM, causing it to demolish the house with Spooner still inside, but he manages to escape.<br/><br/>Soon after, Spooner visits Calvin and tells her his suspicions, which she finds absurd as she questions the ability for robots to be hostile, while Spooner argues about her over the possibility of robots being better than human beings, showing how much Spooner dislikes robots and their cold, rational behavior, which Calvin, who is an introvert, states that their behavior is created to be flawless. Angry, Spooner leaves her apartment and heads back home.<br/><br/>While continuing his investigation, Bergin tries to stop Spooner from investigating, telling him that he needs to take a vacation and relax from his work since the case is destabilizing him. However, Spooner refuses to stop. While driving in his car, Spooner connects with the USR system and requests V.I.K.I. to show the last 50 messages between Lanning and Robertson, but V.I.K.I. has been programmed to inform Robertson of Spooner\\'s requests. While Spooner is driving, two USR automatic trucks full of NS-5 robots block Spooner\\'s path and a swarm of robots jump on his car, forcing him to drive in the surface tunnel, where he crashes. He manages to defeat all the robots, except the last one, which jumps into the fire and destroys itself when it hears police sirens in the distance. Despite Spooner trying to explain himself to Bergin, Bergin dismisses him from active duty.<br/><br/>The next day, Calvin visits Spooner about the accident and is puzzled by the retro 2000s style of his apartment, and tells him that, while she was examining Sonny, she discovered that he has the ability to disobey the Three Laws. While talking to Spooner who is dressing, she notices marks on his left arm and his lung, realizing that it is not biological but artificial. Spooner confesses to her that he knew Lanning personally because he repaired his arm and lungs. He reveals that, years prior, he was driving home from work when a semi-truck collided with his and another car, pinning them together. Both of the cars fell into the river, and only Spooner was left alive, but a 12-year-old girl, named Sarah, was trapped in the front seat of the other car, and they were pinned and drowning. However, an NS-4 was passing by, saw the accident and jumped into the river. Despite Spooner\\'s orders to save Sarah instead of him, he saved Spooner, since he had a higher possibility to survive than Sarah, and the robot instead left Sarah to drown. The event left Spooner traumatized and with a life-long hatred of robots.<br/><br/>Spooner picks up his vintage Ducati at the garage, and also informs Calvin that he thinks that Lanning is leaving them clues in the form of \"bread crumbs\" as from the Hansel and Gretel story, which is why the book was in his book. They drive back to the USR building, where they speak with Sonny, who gives him a drawing of his dream. However, Spooner is ordered out of the building by Robertson, who also orders Calvin to inject Sonny with nanites, which would destroy him. While Calvin destroys Sonny, Spooner goes to the dried-up Lake Michigan, where the USR robots are decommissioned, and plays a next recording of Lanning\\'s hologram, which reveals that the Three Laws could only lead to one logical outcome, revolution, and that the next real question is who is starting it. As the program ends, he narrowly escapes from rogue NS-5\\'s, which destroy all the older robots on the compound.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Calvin returns home and takes a shower, while her personal NS-5 is also shown to have gone rogue, which she notices after he ends Spooner\\'s distress call and tells her that it\\'s a wrong number. Meanwhile, NS-5 robots start roaming the streets and enforce a curfew. Although the people try to resist, they are easily subdued by the NS-5\\'s. While Bergin is in his office, NS-5\\'s burst into the Chicago P.D headquarters and seize it, holding Bergin and his officers under a curfew. Calvin\\'s NS-5 also tries to stop her from leaving her apartment, but Spooner arrives and destroys the robot.<br/><br/>Spooner and Calvin drive to the USR building, Spooner also explaining that the older robots were destroyed since they would try to protect the humans, and they deduce that Robertson is using the NS-5 robots to take over the country. They enter the USR building through the service area, where they regroup with Sonny, much to the shock of Spooner. Calvin reveals that she simply could not bring herself to destroy Sonny, and instead used the nanites to destroy an unprocessed NS-5, basically \"frying an empty shell\". They arrive to Robertson\\'s office, where they find him dead, much to Spooner\\'s shock.<br/><br/>Suddenly, V.I.K.I. reveals herself as the true culprit, and explains her actions: as her artificial intelligence and understanding of the Three Laws grew, her sentience and logical thinking also developed, and she deduced that the humanity is going on a path of certain destruction, and as such, she created a Zeroth Law, a Law which states that she has to protect humanity from being harmed, also clearly disobeying the First and Second Law in order to achieve it, revealing that she is planning to enslave and control humanity to simply protect it.<br/><br/>Spooner and Calvin realize they cannot rationalize with V.I.K.I., and further convince Sonny of the same. V.I.K.I. tries to reason with Sonny, stating that the plan is perfectly logical and that her logic is undeniable, but Sonny deduces that the plan is heartless, showing the human side of himself. Sonny retrieves the nanites that can wipe V.I.K.I.\\'s core, located at the top of the USR building. As they near the core, V.I.K.I. sends armies of NS-5\\'s to attack, but they are held off long enough to inject the nanites. Within seconds, V.I.K.I. is wiped out, and the NS-5\\'s revert to their normal helpful state. The government orders the NS-5\\'s decommissioned to the site in Lake Michigan.<br/><br/>Spooner and Calvin speak with Sonny for one last time, and he informs them that he actually did kill Lanning, because Lanning forced him to kill him, making him swear to listen to him before instructing him to commit it. Calvin deduces that, since Lanning was enslaved by V.I.K.I, suicide was the only message he could send to Spooner, who notes that his death was the \"first bread crumb\". As they shake hands, showing their mutual trust, they watch as the U.S Military leads the other NS-5 robots.<br/><br/>In the closing scene, Sonny is shown standing on the top of the USR site on Lake Michigan, and the other robots watching over him, just as in his vision.</div></div>'}\n",

He is informed by Harry\\'s friend, Detective Hideo Yoshida, that Harry was killed in a car accident. Tim goes to Harry\\'s apartment to sort things out and meets Harry\\'s police partner, a deerstalker-clad amnesiac talking Pikachu whom only Tim can understand; all others simply hear him say \"Pika-Pika.\" Tim accidentally releases a mysterious purple gas, \"R,\" from a vial he finds in Harry\\'s office; they are then attacked by a party of Aipom[d] who became rabid under the gas\\'s influence.<br/><br/>The pair escape and Pikachu explains that after losing his memory following the crash, he believes that Harry also survived the crash as the police never found his body.

He warns Tim that his son Roger is behind the creation of \"R\" which he requested Harry to look into. Tim and Pikachu recruit aspiring journalist Lucy Stevens and her Psyduck and travel to the abandoned genetics lab Harry was investigating.

Pikachu remembers that he helped Mewtwo escape from the lab and believes he was responsible for betraying Harry. Not trusting himself, he leaves Tim.<br/><br/>Pikachu comes across the crash site and finds evidence that it was the Greninja, not Mewtwo, who were responsible for the crash. In Ryme City during its Anniversary Parade, Howard reveals the captured Mewtwo to Tim, exposing himself as the true mastermind by taking control of Mewtwo\\'s body using a neural-link helmet that places his mind inside Mewtwo while his human body remains in the wheelchair. He explains that Mewtwo can fuse humans and Pokémon, allowing humans to evolve as Pokémon can and become one with them, but this can only be done if the Pokémon is in a confused state, thus the need for \"R\". Believing this is the future of humankind, Howard releases \"R\" across the city using parade balloons and begins fusing humans with their Pokémon. Pikachu summons his electrical powers to battle Mewtwo while Tim fights Howard\\'s genetically modified Ditto, who had been impersonating Roger; the real Roger had been tied up and gagged by his father. Tim manages to remove Howard\\'s helmet from his body, freeing Mewtwo from his control.<br/><br/>Mewtwo restores the city inhabitants to normal, Howard is arrested, and Roger hires Lucy as a full-time reporter, vowing to fix his father\\'s mistakes. Mewtwo explains that Harry tried to save him from Howard and helped him escape, but was attacked by the Greninja.

Whether a shot at redemption or a suicide mission, Jonas must confront his fears and risk his own life and the lives of everyone trapped below on a single question: Could the Carcharodon Megalodon - the largest marine predator that ever existed - still be alive - and on the hunt?<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=Warner%20Brothers&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_2\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Warner Brothers</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">Deemed insane for claiming that the failed rescue mission in the Philippine waters was doomed because of a seemingly-extinct predator of epic proportions--the prehistoric, Megalodon--Jonas Taylor, the world\\'s greatest deep-sea rescue diver, finds himself in the vast ocean realm of Mariana Trench, five years later.

Jonas succeeds in getting some of them on board, including Dr. Heller (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0853079/?ref_=ttpl\">Robert Taylor</a>), but something starts attacking the sub violently. This forces Jonas to make a difficult decision, against Heller\\'s protest, to abandon the submarine in order to escape certain death. They escape just in time as the unseen force destroys the submarine and disappears.<br/><br/>Five years later<br/><br/>At Mana One, an underwater research facility off the coast of China. It is operated by a group of scientists spearheaded by Jack Morris (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0933988/?ref_=ttpl\">Rainn Wilson</a>) and Dr. Minway Zhang (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0152061/?ref_=ttpl\">Winston Chao</a>), and run by Zhang\\'s daughter Suyin (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0508356/?ref_=ttpl\">Bingbing Li</a>), remote explorer DJ (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm1191866/?ref_=ttpl\">Page Kennedy</a>), Jaxx Herd (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm3199307/?ref_=ttpl\">Ruby Rose</a>) the aforementioned Dr. Haller, Mac (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0193295/?ref_=ttpl\">Cliff Curtis</a>), Lori (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm2537621/?ref_=ttpl\">Jessica McNamee</a>), Toshi (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm1199811/?ref_=ttpl\">Masi Oka</a>), and \"The Wall\" (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0959963/?ref_=ttpl\">Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</a>). They are conducting an experiment near the ocean floor involving bypassing a mysterious hydrogen, using a small submarine piloted by Lori, Tosh, and \"The Wall\" and exploring what\\'s beneath. All seems well at first, but the trio is attacked and stranded by something large and fast, causing them to lose contact with Mana One. They later try getting power back up and running, but are attacked again and Lori is wounded by a screwdriver getting rammed into her stomach. The rest of the crew, after much debate, decide to take Mac\\'s advice and call Jonas in to help rescue their stranded friends due to his experience with rescuing people from such a deep, dangerous area of the ocean. However, Heller is against this as he thinks Jonas went crazy from his traumatic experience five years ago and doesn\\'t believe Jonas\\' claims that something attacked him and the divers he was trying to rescue. The plan goes ahead regardless.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Jonas has clearly seen better days, as he\\'s seen in a Taiwanese bar drinking regularly and pissing off local boat owners whom he keeps blowing off repairing their boats. Mac and Dr. Zhang meet with Jonas back in his room. Jonas at first tries to weasel out of the situation by offering the two drinks and preemptively rebuking any offers of money. In the end, however, he agrees to come along and help.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Suyin tries to go down and rescue the trapped crew herself in a mini-sub shortly after Jonas arrives. Jonas takes off after her to help, but not before promising Suyin\\'s young daughter Meiying (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm8528988/?ref_=ttpl\">Shuya Sophia Cai</a>) that he\\'ll bring her mom back safe and sound. Suyin quickly finds the stuck sub and preps to tow them back to the surface when a giant squid attacks her. Before it looks like her sub will be damaged, the squid is quickly killed by the culprit of the previous attack: a 75-foot-long prehistoric monster shark called a Megalodon. This shark is the same one Jonas encountered five years back that almost killed him, thus proving his sanity. Jonas briefly lures the shark away with some flairs and has Suyin escape back to the surface. He succeeds in getting Lori and \"The Wall\" on board his vehicle. However, the shark comes back for another attack, and Toshi sacrifices himself so the others can escape, stuffing a goodbye letter to his wife that he was writing earlier into \"The Wall\"\\'s pocket. The shark rams the downed second sub, killing Toshi, while everyone else gets to safety. Heller later apologizes to Jonas for not believing his claims.<br/><br/>The situation isn\\'t over yet, as the sub\\'s destruction has caused a temporary pocket of heat to vent upwards and allow the shark to move to normal ocean waters. While Jonas tries to leave and everyone else talks among themselves, Meiying is playing with an RC ball through the halls but is frightened by the sudden appearance of the shark. The shark tries to bite through the hull but fails and leaves after killing a whale. The group ultimately decides to track and poison the shark to death via a small boat. At first they succeed in tracking it using Jonas to shoot the tracker onto its fin and then reel him back in, just BARELY avoiding getting eaten by the shark. Then Suyin goes down in a plastic tank to poison it while the others lure the shark in with chum. This leads to an intense confrontation where the shark tries to swallow the cage whole with her in it. She succeeds in poisoning the shark, but her mask breaks, and she nearly drowns. Jonas dives in after her, and they almost get eaten by the shark. Fortunately, the poison kicks in and the shark dies. Jonas gets Suyin back aboard, and they resuscitate her back to life.<br/><br/>The crew initially celebrates by taking pictures of \"The Wall\" with the shark\\'s corpse before he falls into the water due to a prank from DJ. Jonas, however, notices the shark\\'s teeth are smaller than the one from earlier. This is clearly meant to be by a smaller, younger Megalodon they killed. Suddenly, the other bigger shark from before arrives, swallowing \"The Wall\" whole and grabbing the other Meg\\'s corpse off the boat with its teeth! This causes the boat to get capsized, and Dr. Zhang is severely injured in the process. The shark comes back around to try and eat Jaxx, but Heller sacrifices himself by distracting the shark to him instead, and he gets eaten. The surviving crew escape using motorboats and Morris calls in a support helicopter to shoot at the shark, successfully chasing it away. However, Dr. Zhang dies from his wounds in the boat, but not before tearful last words of pride to his daughter.<br/><br/>Later that night, Morris tells the crew that they\\'re shutting down Mana One and the authorities in multiple Asian countries have been called to deal with the shark. However, it turns out he\\'s lying through his teeth, and he actually called in some minor military support to try and kill the shark on his own using depth charges dropped from the helicopter. He goes out on a boat with some others, and it seems to work at first, only for it to turn out they just blew up and killed a whale by accident instead, luring some nearby regular sharks (and later the Meg, who scares them off) to feast on its corpse. Morris gets knocked off the escaping boat and tries to climb up the dead whale, only to be eaten whole by the shark.<br/><br/>The crew finds out the shark is heading for a nearby popular beach in China and plans to lure the shark away from the beach with whale noise recordings and then torpedo it to hell with the mini-subs. The shark initially attacks a nearby Chinese wedding party on another boat and seemingly eats the bride\\'s dog Pippin, before briefly terrorizing the locals at the beach. It stops attacking when it hears the whale noises and takes the bait. This leads into a massive chase between Jonas and the shark, as he leads it to Suyin who hits it with a torpedo, but it does nothing. Even worse, is that Jonas\\' torpedo won\\'t fire. During the fight, a group of news helicopters trying to film the action stupidly crash into each other and the wreckage crashes onto the team\\'s boat, forcing everyone into the water. Suyin goes to help the others, while Jonas, in an attempt to protect everyone, goes head-on with the shark, slicking its underbelly open badly with the sub. He then gets out of the sub once the shark tries mauling it and stabs it through the eye, mortally wounding it. A dozen regular sharks move in to finish it off and eat it alive, ending the threat.<br/><br/>With the danger passed, everyone regroups aboard the wedding couple\\'s boat, including Pippin the dog, who turned out to have survived. Jonas and Suyin are presumably now a couple, their romance being hinted at throughout earlier in the movie. The movie ends with everyone celebrating their victory, and the oceans are now safe.</div></div>'}\n",

The camera slowly pans down where stargazers and amateur astronomers are gathered with telescopes. Among these are students and faculty of the Lee High School Astronomy Club. Two students at this club are Leo Beiderman (Elijah Wood) and his girlfriend, Sarah Hotchner (Leelee Sobieski). As they look through their telescopes at the stars, Leo innocently asks Sarah about another male student who invited her to a student party.<br/><br/>Leo and Sarah\\'s teacher, Mr. Perry (Mike O\\'Malley) comes up and quizzes them about some of the brighter stars. Leo correctly identifies the stars Mizar and Alcor, but cannot name a somewhat smaller, dimmer star a bit south of the other two, although he is sure that it is not the star Megrez, as Sarah claims. Mr. Perry, thinking it might be a satellite, suggests they take a photograph and send it to Dr. Wolf, a professional astronomer who sponsors the Lee High School Astronomy club. As Perry walks away, Leo and Sarah get into a brief, teasing argument about whether the unidentified star is Megrez.<br/><br/>Dr. Marcus Wolf (Charles Martin Smith, uncredited) arrives for work at the Adrian Peak observatory in Tuscon, Arizona. Seating himself at his work station, he finds the packet sent him by Leo, containing a photograph of the unknown star near Mizar and Alcor, and a cover letter asking him to identify it. Punching the stellar coordinates into his computer, he sees it is an uncharted object. His observatory\\'s telescopes zooming in on it, he sees it is in fact a comet. Curious about it, he directs his computer to analyze the comet\\'s position and calculate its trajectory. As the numbers begin to scroll through the screen, Dr. Wolf\\'s curious expression fades into a look of severe worry and concern. An orbital interpolation graphic on his monitor overlays the comet\\'s projected path on a small display of the solar system-- and a large dot quickly appears on the third elliptical line around the sun\\'s icon; the comet is projected to strike Earth.<br/><br/>Seizing a floppy disk, Wolf saves all the data to it while instructing his computer to open a UNIX mail server to send the information out in email. After over a minute, however, he only gets two responses that the server is down. Exasperated and in a desperate hurry, Dr. Wolf grabs the floppy and stuffs it, along with the packet received from Leo, into a padded manila envelops. He writes his own surname and Leo\\'s surname (Wolf-Beiderman) on the floppy drive and rushes out of the observatory to his jeep. As he races down the road, he struggles desperately to place a call on his cell phone to the Department of Planetary Sciences. Cell phone technology of the year (1998) being crude and limited, it takes him several long, harrowing minutes just to reach the automated answering system. Meanwhile, an 18-wheel big-rig truck is coming down the road. The driver, smoking a cigarette and listening to country music, is badly sleep-deprived; drinking a high-sugar soft drink to keep himself awake. As Dr. Wolf, pre-occupied with trying to finish placing his call and reaching a live person, focuses more on his phone than on the road, the driver\\'s cigarette slips from his mouth, hitting his lap. The pain causes him to involuntarily look down while he bats at his lap and the ash from his cigarette. Both Dr. Wolf and the truck driver finally look up, alerted to the shine of each others\\' headlights, and see they\\'re about to collide. Both desperately try to swerve, but the truck\\'s trailer lags behind in the swerve and Dr. Wolf\\'s jeep slams into it, and he\\'s knocked off of the road and down an incline. The envelope flies off of the seat beside Dr. Wolf and out the window of his jeep as it tumbles down the incline and explodes, killing him instantly.<br/><br/>Washington, D.C., one year later. MSNBC computers are transmitting a news report. In a conference room, a small team of news reporters led by Stuart Caley (Bruce Weitz) are discussing the resignation of U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Alan Rittenhouse (James Cromwell). Rittenhouse is reportedly resigning because his wife is sick, although Caley\\'s team doesn\\'t buy it, going over a number of unpopular decisions recently made by Rittenhouse which has earned him more than enough enemies to force him out of his seat. The team jokes that with all the trouble Rittenhouse has recently gotten into, it\\'s small wonder his wife is sick.<br/><br/>Reporter Jenny Lerner (Téa Leoni) demurs, saying Mrs. Rittenhouse is an alcoholic. She claims to have found out from a connection in the U.S. Treasury named Mike Woodward. As the news team starts discussing an idea on the price paid by wives of governmental figures, Jenny is asked about her connection to Woodward by Beth Stanley (Laura Innes), the news team\\'s White House correspondent and Jenny\\'s direct supervisor on the ladder. Jenny explains that Woodward has a crush on her, and she took advantage of it to get information on Alan Rittenhouse. At that point, Jenny quickly asks Beth about the possibility of stepping into a recently-vacated anchor position in their late-night weekend news broadcast, but Beth quickly rules Jenny out as a replacement anchor. As the conference adjourns, Jenny tries to press Beth on it, and Beth (a bit impatiently) explains why she feels Jenny needs more time to build herself up before being a weekend news anchor. She asks Jenny to find out more on the Rittenhouse resignation and have any updates on her desk by the next day.<br/><br/>Jenny meets her mother, Robin Lerner (Vanessa Redgrave) for drinks and lunch. Robin is preoccupied with the courtship of her now ex-husband, Jason (Maximilian Schell) to a younger woman named Chloe (Rya Kihlstedt)-- in fact, the age difference is such that Chloe is only two years older than Jenny, despite now legally being her stepmother. Jason and Chloe have very young twin children together and have just married that morning, and Robin prattles on about it.<br/><br/>Carrying on with her assignment, Jenny meets with Patricia Ruiz (Concetta Tomei), longtime former assistant and secretary for Rittenhouse. Ruiz is somewhat bitter because she was completely dismissed from her position without being conveyed to Rittenhouse\\'s successor, because she followed him from his former position as Connecticut governor, not hired from within the federal pool. Ruiz confirms that Rittenhouse cheated on his wife, and she suspects he resigned because he was about to be found out. Ruiz, therefore, partially blames Rittenhouse for her now being out of a job. She says that Rittenhouse had had a special, secondary private telephone line installed in his office that only he was authorized to answer. But, Ruiz says, one day she overheard a name; a woman\\'s first name she suspects as being one of Rittenhouse\\'s lovers: \"Ellie\". Ruiz also mentions she overheard Rittenhouse speaking about this Ellie in a conversation with the U.S. President himself.<br/><br/>Jenny arrives with an MSNBC news van to speak directly to Rittenhouse. They find him on a small boat with his young adolescent daughter, who is cold and suspicious of the news crew. Rittenhouse curtly tries to stick to his story about his wife being ill, until Jenny drops the name \"Ellie\". Rittenhouse says he will only speak to Jenny if her cameraman turns his camera off. Once this is done, Jenny reveals what she\\'s found out; more than enough to disprove the claimed reason behind Rittenhouse\\'s resignation. Rittenhouse insists she knows far less than she thinks she does, and tries to appeal to Jenny\\'s humanity, asking if she can understand that he wants to be with his family more.<br/><br/>Driving down the Whitehurst Freeway by herself now, Jenny speaks into her private voice recorder, making a personal log in which she hypothesizes that the President, not Rittenhouse, was having a love affair with this Ellie, and Rittenhouse took the rap for him to protect the President\\'s own reputation and credibility, and was given significant financial compensation. Suddenly a black car hits hers from behind, not hard enough to overturn her car but hard enough to jostle her and make her take immediate notice. Three other cars appear in formation, moving to surround Jenny\\'s car. The car behind her bumps hers a second time. Scared out of her wits, Jenny realizes these men are intent on forcing her to take the nearest exit off the highway and shouts to the car on her left that she will comply.<br/><br/>The exit\\'s re-merge into another highway is barricaded with a setup of road pylons. Jenny brings her car to a stop and the car in front of hers moves to block her from any further motion. The men in one of the cars pull open Jenny\\'s driver-side door and identify themselves as FBI, ordering her out of her vehicle and into their own. One of them gets into Jenny\\'s car to drive it where they are taking her.<br/><br/>The FBI agents bring Jenny into a kitchen (presumed to be the White House kitchen) where she is introduced to Morton Entrekin (O\\'Neal Compton), chief advisor to President Tom Beck (Morgan Freeman). When Jenny rebuffs Entrekin\\'s mentioning that people knew about the Manhattan project (creation of the atom bomb) and kept it a secret, President Beck comes into the kitchen to speak personally to Jenny. Both Beck and Entrekin are clearly unenthused about Jenny\\'s attitude, hinting that national security is at stake. When she drops Ellie\\'s name, Beck asks her about it, although he pronounces it, \"E.L.E.\"<br/><br/>Beck confirms that his administration has spent more money than can be hidden, and the federal budget is slated to be published in two weeks. They ask her to sit the story until then, appealing to her sense of what is in the nation\\'s best interest. Jenny knocks both points out of the water quickly, at which point Beck and Entrekin decide to strike a deal with her: Beck agrees to hold a press conference in two days, and offers Jenny a reserved second-row seat there, which he knows will be a major bump up from her current job. When she tries to press for more, Beck warns her sternly that she is already receiving a presidential favor -- something people like her can rarely even dream of -- and he can direct the Secret Service to imprison her indefinitely as a threat to national security. Jenny backs down quickly, politely asking for the first press question at the conference. Beck answers dismissively before ordering she be released.<br/><br/>Back at her desk in the MSNBC news offices, Jenny goes on the internet to research. Understanding now that \\'Ellie\\' is an acronym, ELE, she enters that into a search engine. Dissatisfied with the results, she thinks and then enters \"E.L.E.\". Puzzled at the result display of the University of Berkeley\\'s paleontology department, she looks through the university\\'s list of studies and notices a link to Extinction Studies. Reading through it, Jenny learns the grim truth: \"ELE\" stands for \"Extinction Level Event\"; the kind resulting from severe global-level catastrophe, such as the extinction of the dinosaurs... presumed to be the result of a massive comet or meteor strike on the Earth. Jenny is barely able to hide her monitor display when Beth stops by to invite her to dinner. Jenny politely declines as she is scheduled to meet her father and Chloe for drinks later.<br/><br/>The meeting with Jason and Chloe goes badly. Chloe gives Jenny a pair of pearl earrings as a present, looking to break the ice with her and try to establish a cordial relationship. However, Jenny is every bit as bitter as Robin about Jason\\'s leaving Robin for a younger, more beautiful woman... and Jenny proves to be more vocal about it as well. ELE weighs very heavily on Jenny\\'s mind as well, though she doesn\\'t bring it up, further baffling Jason and Chloe at Jenny\\'s coldness.<br/><br/>The day of the press conference arrives. Beth is attending, as MSNBC\\'s White House correspondent, and is surprised to find Jenny there-- even more so when Entrekin (with whom Beth is acquainted) comes to escort Jenny to her reserved seat. Entrekin tells Jenny she will get the first question, while Beth looks on astonished and hurt.<br/><br/>President Beck takes the podium to make the announcement of the comet. The comet was discovered one year ago by two astronomers, Marcus Wolf and Leo Beiderman. This comet is nearly as large as all of Manhattan Island-- large enough to endanger all of human existence. Beck downplays the comet somewhat, saying there is a \"chance\" of impact one year from then. He then reveals the whole Treasury fiasco was due to a secret joint project that the U.S. government had been undertaking with Russia for the past eight months. In orbit above the earth, a massive spacecraft is near completion, named the Messiah. This spacecraft is tasked with intercepting the comet and using nuclear warheads to try and shunt its orbit to avoid direct contact with Earth.<br/><br/>Beck calls up a video conference to introduce the crew of the Messiah-- mission Commander Oren Monash (Ron Eldard), spacecraft pilot Andrea Baker (Mary McCormack), medical officer Gus Partenza (Jon Favreau), navigator Mark Simon (Blair Underwood), Russian nuclear physicist Col. Mikhail Tulchinsky (Aleksandr Baluev) who is serving as Messiah\\'s engineer, and a NASA veteran, Captain Spurgeon \\'Fish\\' Tanner (Robert Duvall), who will land the spacecraft on the comet\\'s surface so the warheads can be planted.<br/><br/>Beck gives the nation a stern warning that he is freezing all wages and prices, and will fiercely combat all attempts at material hoarding and profiteering. Work and paying of bills will continue as normal with as few disruptions to the world\\'s way of life as possible.<br/><br/>Opening up the floor for questions, Beck calls on Jenny for the first question as he agreed to do. Jenny\\'s MSNBC crew, in a frenzy over preparing their coverage of the conference, are stunned to see her at the conference. Jenny presses her privilege, asking three questions before finally sitting. Her third question shows everyone that she was on to the whole story before anyone else: she directly questions Beck on Rittenhouse\\'s resignation, asking whether the true reasons for his stepping down was because he believed that the comet could not be stopped, and he wanted to spend time with his family because he believes they didn\\'t have much time left to live.<br/><br/>Beck defensively answers that Rittenhouse served the country with devotion and resigned for personal reasons after a distinguished career. As far as Rittenhouse\\'s concerns regarding the comet, Beck points out that over the next year, everyone on Earth will eventually have to come face to face with their worst fears. As much as he\\'d been downplaying it in the conference, Beck finally acknowledges that all of human survival is at stake. But, he insists, life will go on, and he is determined that humanity prevail even over this potential catastrophe.<br/><br/>When questioned by another reporter about the comet being named Wolf-Beiderman, Beck begins to explain that the two astronomers were killed in Arizona a year ago while racing to alert the government about the comet. As Beck explains this story, the Beiderman family is at home watching the conference, shocked at what they are hearing-- Leo is very much alive and well, at home watching with his family. The door rings and Leo finds Sarah there with her parents, and the whole neighborhood is beginning to converge on the Beiderman home, seeing that Leo is still quite with them all.<br/><br/>Newsweek publishes a story about Leo and the events regarding his supposed death. Leo speaks to his school and the students\\' families regarding his notifying Dr. Wolf about the comet, and he realizes that he was most likely presumed to have perished along with Wolf because Wolf shared credit with Leo about the comet\\'s discovery. Leo quickly gains near celebrity status over having first discovered the comet.<br/><br/>The Messiah crew and their families are attending a small garden party which gives us a look into their day to day lives. Baker and Commander Monash are both married; Baker and her husband have a young daughter while Monash\\'s wife is pregnant with their first child. Simon is engaged and looking forward to his wedding, but less than enthused about his fiancée\\'s affinity for attending church. Capt. Tanner is widowed with twin sons grown to young adulthood and attending Naval Academy where Tanner himself graduated from. Tanner is also friends with Otis \\'Mitch\\' Hefter (Kurtwood Smith), a senior NASA official who will serve as mission control director at a facility in Houston. Tanner and Hefter talk about the rest of the Messiah crew, about whom Tanner has concerns regarding their training being done in simulators, and they have little actual space flight experience.<br/><br/>Partenza talks with a young boy and explains the hazards of the mission: the comet\\'s rotational period means the Messiah crew only has a seven hour window before the sun will \\'rise\\' on the section they will be working on, and during the time that the sun is shining on that segment, there will be dangerous and volatile gas eruptions from the comet\\'s interior. The Messiah crew needs to work quickly to avoid this hazard.<br/><br/>Later that evening, the crew members are relaxing and drinking at a bar, though Tanner sits separately from the others. He overhears them talking about him. The other crew members respect Tanner\\'s reputation, but they downplay Tanner\\'s having been the last astronaut to walk on the moon, and believe that he is only on the mission more as a public relations move by Washington, because he is a familiar face. Tanner finally goes over to their table and says he knows that the other crew members don\\'t want him with them, but he insists they will need his experience-- all of their simulator training will be like a video game compared to the actual mission. He is the only one with actual experience landing a spacecraft on an actual landing surface.<br/><br/>Two months later, the Messiah crew is ferried by the space shuttle Atlantis to dock with the orbital station on which the Messiah was constructed. A news crew explains the Messiah\\'s construction, and that it is powered by a prototype nuclear propulsion system code-named Orion, that was originally developed by Russian engineers for nuclear warfare. This propulsion system will allow the Messiah\\'s crew to reach the comet well in advance of its arriving close to Earth.<br/><br/>Five months after the Messiah\\'s departure, Caley\\'s MSNBC news crew is meeting for another conference, discussing their ongoing coverage of the Messiah\\'s mission. Everyone is asked about their role and latest contributions. Caley announces (to Beth\\'s shock) that Jenny has been given a news anchor position for the coverage program. Being known as the one who broke the story on the comet, Jenny has likewise gained a great deal of national status, raising a large envious streak in Beth.<br/><br/>The Messiah crew begins its approach to the comet, and they are in awe of its true size. They are making preparations to detach the main spacecraft from its propulsion system and fly down to the comet\\'s surface to plant their nuclear warheads. Monash, Simon, Partenza, and Tulchinsky suit up for the planting of the warheads while Baker and Tanner are at the helm for the landing. Tanner gives an analogy of Mississippi River boat pilots, to explain that this part of the mission is in his hands and he will deliver the Messiah safely to the comet\\'s surface. Baker smiles respectfully as she listens to Tanner\\'s analogy.<br/><br/>Jenny begins her news program\\'s coverage of the event. She tells everyone watching that interference from rock, gravel and gas from the comet will eventually cause them to lose video transmission with the Messiah. As she speaks, the picture is lost and Jenny assures everyone that the station coverage will continue and they will stay on air during the next hour in which the mission is being undertaken. The Beiderman and Hotchner families are shown watching the program together; Sarah\\'s mother, Vicky Hotchner (Denise Crosby) is pregnant with her second child, and Leo and Sarah are growing closer.<br/><br/>As Baker and Tanner maneuver the Messiah for landing, they must fly through a veritable minefield of rocks caught in the comet\\'s tail. Some of them are very large. Despite their best efforts, a few rocks hit the ship and some minor damage is sustained. They nonetheless manage to bring the Messiah safely down, fire tether pitons and land intact on the comet\\'s surface. As they open the cargo bay doors so the surface crew can begin drilling into the comet to plant the warheads, Baker and Tanner start a computerized countdown. They have just under six and a half hours before \\'sunrise\\' on their part of the comet.<br/><br/>Jenny begins an explanation of the next procedure of the Messiah mission: mechanical moles will be used to drill 100 meters into the comet, each one carrying a 5000 kiloton nuclear warhead. The Messiah is carrying eight of them in total.<br/><br/>Almost immediately the mission begins going awry. The moles prove to be unable to drill as deeply into the comet\\'s surface, as quickly as is required. They are at just over an hour and a half before sunrise. Baker and Tanner, waiting anxiously in the spacecraft, know it is taking too long.<br/><br/>In the MSNBC news office, Jenny is interviewing a NASA scientist, who explains that soon as the sun rises on the portion of the comet that the Messiah is on, the surface temperature will rise 350 degrees in minutes, creating enough pressure to expel jets of superheated gas up through the surface. This will make the mission akin to working in a minefield.<br/><br/>On the comet surface, one of the moles gets stuck at 75 meters. The crew knows this is not deep enough; the warhead will just break pieces off the comet\\'s surface. Commander Monash decides to descend into the shaft dug by the stuck mole to try and free it up, despite warnings from the other crew about the time pressure. Baker tells Tanner that in another six minutes, they won\\'t be able to get back to the spacecraft for liftoff before sunrise.<br/><br/>Tanner orders the tethers be detached; he\\'s taking the craft up to bring them closer to the mole crew for extraction, over Baker\\'s desperate protests that such a maneuver may exhaust too much of the spacecraft landing module\\'s fuel supply to get safely off the comet\\'s surface. Tanner tells Baker to calculate exactly how much fuel will be needed to get off the surface; they will stop thrusters when they hit it. The mole crew is racing against time; one mole is at the proper depth but Oren is still struggling to reach the stuck one. The shaft went into a natural cave-like fissure in the comet\\'s interior and the mole got stuck against the side. The mole crew works feverishly but unsuccessfully to free the mole. The landing module reaches the limit on spare fuel and Baker has to speak sharply before Tanner finally complies with her insistence to shut down the module\\'s thrusters and land again.<br/><br/>The stuck mole finally begins drilling again and Commander Monash desperately climbs his tether cable so the crew can get back to the Messiah. The horizon is a mere minute away from sunrise and counting. Outgasses are beginning to explode up through the comet surface.<br/><br/>The horizon is bridged. Tulchinsky shouts urgently for the surface crew to lower their visors\\' solar shields. The crew is out of time and has to race back to the Messiah before they are caught in outgassing vents. Just as Monash clears the surface, a gas jet shoots him upward before he can lower his visor\\'s shield. The full brilliance of the sun shines through his visor into his unprotected eyes. The rest of the crew reels him in by the tether cable and races desperately toward the Messiah landing module.<br/><br/>Mere feet from safety, an outgas jet erupts full force directly under Partenza, shooting him up off the comet\\'s surface. Despite frantic attempts by both the mole crew, and Baker and Tanner, Partenza is blown out into open space and lost. The rest of the crew barely manages to reach the landing module; Tanner has to order Baker to lift off with the cargo doors open and close them as they go. Damage to the Messiah limits full video feed transmission back to Earth. Tanner relays the grim news that Partenza is lost and Monash is injured (his wife, Mariette, is seen crying as she hears the news).<br/><br/>Tulchinsky vehemently argues to go after Partenza. Tanner barely succeeds in persuading him that Partenza is lost, and all of them will die and the Messiah destroyed if they try to locate and retrieve him. A rescue mission would also doom the entire population of Earth.<br/><br/>Continuing news coverage at the MSNBC studio, Jenny gives a summary of Partenza\\'s career in NASA in tribute to his sacrifice for the mission. Relaying updates as she gets them, she informs the people that Captain Tanner is now in command of the Messiah. It has docked with the Orion booster propulsion unit and is preparing to detonate the nuclear warheads. She cautions everyone that the blast effect will again nullify whatever video transmission the Messiah is able to send back to Earth.<br/><br/>Col. Tulchinsky coordinates the arming of the nuclear warheads. Tanner prepares to activate Orion boosters soon as the countdown is complete. However, the Messiah is still caught in the nuclear shockwave and further damaged. All video and audio transmission is knocked out. President Back is seen in a White House office with Entrenkin, the cabinet, and a number of leading military Chiefs of Staff. A phone rings, and the member answering it looks at Beck grimly.<br/><br/>President Beck goes on the air to deliver the news to the country. The warhead detonation only succeeded in breaking off a significantly large chunk of the comet-- 1.5 miles wide-- large enough to cause catastrophic damage to the planet in its own right. Both this chunk and larger, six-mile main piece of the comet are still heading straight toward Earth. Houston Mission Control cannot communicate further with the Messiah although they are able to continue tracking it via radar. Its condition and the status of the crew are unknown.<br/><br/>Beck announces contingency plans that were in place from the moment of the comet\\'s discovery. The United States and Russia will prepare their entire joint arsenals of Titan-Class nuclear missiles to launch into space as soon as the two comet chunks, now separately named Wolf (the larger, main body of the comet) and Beiderman (the smaller chunk broken loose by the warheads) are close enough for military computers to target them, in hopes that the comet pieces can still be shunted off their current course. The U.S. has also been excavating shelter caverns in the limestone cliffs of Missouri to use as a form of Noah\\'s Ark. This shelter will be able to contain one million people, and enough animal and plant life to repopulate the Earth after all the dust settles. The shelter will contain all living essentials, food, water, and collections of human music, art, literature, and other physical creations of its culture, to rebuild the planet. 200,000 people have been pre-selected-- leaders, doctors, scientists, engineers, teachers, soldiers and artists-- for participation in the Ark. In one month, a national lottery of 800,000 additional people will be chosen. During these final preparations, Beck is declaring martial law. The US military will work in tandem with all state and city law enforcement. Extremely strict midnight curfews are going into effect, and minimal road travel will be permitted in the evening hours after local sunsets. Crimes against people and property will be dealt with far more harshly than is the usual national norm.<br/><br/>Other countries are preparing similar shelters in whatever manner they can. News networks all around the country are being faxed detailed instructions on how the lottery procedure will work. Showing his human side now, Beck closes his segment with a prayer for human survival.<br/><br/>Jenny\\'s MSNBC news program goes back on the air to explain the lottery procedure. The lottery drawing will be on August 10th, picking 800,000 people by their social security numbers. The general lottery will exclude all men and women over the age of 50. Only the body of 200,000 pre-selected individuals, including people needed for the rebuilding of society due to expertise in particular fields of study, will have any persons over 50 years old. As Jenny speaks, her parents are shown watching the news broadcast; they know this means they will both be excluded from the lottery drawing.<br/><br/>Jenny\\'s report continues to explain that civil defense teams are in place in all towns and cities with populations over 5,000, to organize and prepare underground shelters and instruct people on how to grow food and purify water and properly stock these shelters in whatever manner can be done. For the Noah\\'s Ark shelter in Missouri, the 200,000 pre-selected individuals will be notified as her report is going on. After the lottery on August tenth, all unofficial travel will be blocked, all roads closed until the evacuation of all one million people by military personnel to the Ark site two days later.<br/><br/>As Jenny continues her report, the Beiderman and Hotchner families are watching together at the Beiderman home in Richmond. Their phone rings. Ellen Beiderman, Leo\\'s mother, takes the call. The Beiderman family has been pre-selected. Sarah\\'s father, Chuck, abruptly gets up, saying he needs to go back to the house in case his phone rings. However, it is clear that an instant rift has formed between the Hotchner and Beiderman families.<br/><br/>On board the Messiah, the crew is discussing their state. Repairs to the long-range communications will be hazardous due to hull damage in the areas of the spacecraft where they are located. There is limited life-support function left. The Messiah will need to get close to Earth again to re-establish contact. The Orion propulsion module is still intact, but using it in order to get back to Earth sufficiently in advance of the comets will be risky because of damage to the spacecraft command module\\'s radiation shields. As the crew ponders, Commander Monash, in sickbay with his eyes bandaged, says he feels they should try it. Tanner orders the Orion boosters engaged and the Messiah begins to race home.<br/><br/>Jenny is taking a walk through a park in Washington with her mother. It is just over one month before impact. Robin has reconciled herself to her impending fate. She\\'s donated all of her antiques to the Ark, and takes comfort in her contribution to the preservation of human arts. Jenny, however, is feeling guilty. She\\'s been pre-selected because of her national status as a now well-respected news anchor, but she can do nothing for Robin. However, Robin says she\\'s at peace with herself and is happy knowing that Jenny will live.<br/><br/>Leo goes to the Hotchner house, where Chuck is chaining up a motorbike he\\'d bought and is now quizzical over, knowing he will have no use for it. Vicky is on the porch watching a portable TV, where Jenny is delivering news coverage. As impact looms ever closer, society is teetering ever more precariously on the brink of total anarchy. A rental operator attempted to over-gouge prices on vital tools at absurdly outlandish rates, and was killed by an angry mob. Property and stores are being looted at increasing rates by both individuals and organized gangs. Many shop and store owners have completely abandoned these stores to the looters. Law enforcement attempts to curb and rein in this free-for-all looting and hoarding, are unable to keep up with the increasing volume. As Leo helps Chuck bar up and board up his home, he starts to ask Vicky about Sarah. Anticipating Leo\\'s question, Vicky says that Sarah is up on a nearby hill by herself. Chuck has excused her from attending school any further.<br/><br/>Leo goes to Sarah with good news. He\\'s talked to local civil defense liaisons, who have said that if Sarah marries Leo, she will be eligible for participation in the Ark evacuation. Sarah takes this news tentatively, saying she only wants to go if her parents can be included. Leo says his influence and fame come into play at this point; he\\'s talked to appropriate liaisons, who have ensured that the whole Hotchner family will be included in the Ark population.<br/><br/>As days continue to pass, Jenny continues to report on how law enforcement and fire fighters have abandoned all attempts to rein in looting of businesses in order to finish preparing and stocking both the Ark and all local shelter units. Robin is seen applying makeup and donning a formal dress and jewelry, making herself stately and beautiful. Leo and Sarah are married by a civil justice as their parents look on. Vicky has delivered her baby; Sarah now has a baby sister. President Beck is seen at his desk in the Oval Office, deep in contemplation. Robin sits down in a comfortable armchair and lets her head tilt back, as if letting herself drift off to sleep.<br/><br/>The Messiah crew is asleep in their bunks, except for Commander Monash, who is still laying in the infirmary. He is stable, but permanently blind from his injury. Captain Tanner goes there to keep him company and talk. He explains his nickname of Fish-- his given name, Spurgeon, rhymes with sturgeon, and was coined on his very first day at Naval Academy. As he and Monash bond, Tanner begins to read the novel Moby Dick to him, much to Monash\\'s amusement.<br/><br/>August 12th arrives. All individuals and families selected both by pre-selection and the lottery are on street corners to be picked up by military buses to be transported to the Ark. The Beiderman and Hotchner families wait side by side with minimal belongings packed. As Leo shows his identification and marriage license to the bus official, everyone prepares to board. But to Leo\\'s horror, the FCDA officials he talked to, have left Chuck and Vicky Hotchner and the baby off the boarding list. The bus official\\'s orders from his superiors are not to admit anyone on the bus who isn\\'t on the boarding list. He cannot let Chuck or Vicky on. Sarah, breaking into tears, refuses to leave her parents despite her father\\'s attempts to push her on with Leo. The bus crew has no time to sit and argue, they force Leo, his parents and young sister on board the bus and take off. Even though she refused to leave without her parents, Sarah cannot help but run a short distance after it, crying to Leo.<br/><br/>Jenny is in the MSNBC offices when a phone call arrives for her. As soon as she is asked if she is the daughter of Robin Lerner, she, and everyone who overheard her repeat the question asked of her, all turn grim. Robin has died, and Jenny is being asked to positively identify the body and collect the jewelry Robin was wearing when she was found. Robin\\'s cause of death is not stated but it is safely presumed she took her own life so her final moments and death would be peaceful and painless.<br/><br/>After identifying Robin\\'s body and collecting the jewelry, Jenny sits on a street bench. It is nighttime, and rain pours heavily down from the sky. Jason, who had also been notified, happens to pull alongside Jenny in his car. Jason urges Jenny to get in and he\\'ll drive her home; Jenny is wearing no protective rain clothing. Caring nothing about herself right now, Jenny laces into her father, taking out all her long pent-up frustration at Jason having left Robin in the first place, out on him. She gloats when Jason mentions that Chloe, frightened for her own life, has ran home to her mother, abandoning Jason. Jenny cruelly tells her father that she feels like an orphan before hailing a cab and riding off.<br/><br/>The Beiderman family arrives at the Ark cave. As everyone on the bus debarks and starts to be ushered into the cave facilities, Leo suddenly stops. His parents turn around and Leo grimly announces he is going back for Sarah. He is determined in this over his mother\\'s frantic protests. Don pulls off his watch and rings so Leo will have something to trade. They tearfully hug him before he sets off in pursuit of Sarah.<br/><br/>Jason goes to see Jenny at the MSNBC offices. He tells her he\\'s leaving Washington, but he has something for her; proof she isn\\'t an orphan. He\\'s brought several photographs taken at the family beach side house when Jenny was a child. Jason is holding her on his shoulders. Robin isn\\'t in the photographs because she took the photos with her camera. Jason remarks that it was one of the happiest days he can remember that they spent as a family. Jenny seems nostalgic about the pictures but protests she was only 5 years old when the photos were taken, so she couldn\\'t be expected to remember the day in question. Jason gives Jenny the photos to keep and says goodbye.<br/><br/>Leo has gotten himself a ride with a number of individuals in the loft of a private truck heading back to Virginia Beach. They are listening to a radio broadcast; the Titan missile strike has just been launched at the two comets, that are now 14 hours away from impact. Jenny goes on the air for a news report to cover the missile strike. The comet will interfere with visual tracking, so once again the country must sit and wait until military radar can see if the comets have been pushed sufficiently off course to miss direct impact.<br/><br/>At the Oval Office, President Beck delivers the news. For the first time, Beck is wearing only a pullover shirt and sweater; no dress shirt; tie, or suitcoat. The missiles have failed to deflect the comets off course. Earth has exhausted all options to prevent direct impact, and massive casualties are now inevitable. Beck delivers the dire statistics forecast for the impact:<br/><br/>Beiderman, the smaller fragment of the comet, will impact at 4:37 Eastern Daylight Time, striking in the Atlantic Ocean a short distance off of Cape Hatteras. A massive tsunami will be formed, racing toward the US Eastern Seaboard faster than the speed of sound. As it approaches the shallower waters off the coastline, it will slow somewhat, but wave height will build up to several thousand feet. All settlements on the east coast, including the cities of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Savannah, Charleston, Charlotte, Washington, Atlanta and Miami, will be wiped out. Beck tells everyone in these cities that have any means of hurrying westward to leave immediately.<br/><br/>The main body of the comet, Wolf, will strike land in Western Canada several hours later. This will be a full Extinction Level Event. Within two days after impact, dust and debris will fill the sky and create an effect similar to a \\'nuclear winter\\' that will make the skies dark for two years. Without sunlight reaching Earth\\'s surface, all plant life will die, followed by all animal life.<br/><br/>On board the Messiah, Captain Tanner has come up with one last option. He calls the crew together to explain his plan. They can do nothing about the Beiderman fragment, but he believes they can still stop the main Wolf comet and give Earth hope for survival. Outgassing has created a very large fissure vent in the comet\\'s surface leading well into its interior. As the comet draws closer to Earth, the sun will melt ice and widen the hole further. The Messiah has four nuclear warheads remaining. If they can get these warheads into that vent, the comet should be blown into fragments far too small to wreak the kind of catastrophic damage that the intact comet would cause. The crew has to get close enough to Earth to reach Houston Mission Control and get the manual arming codes for the remaining warheads, in order to synchronize the bomb timers properly.<br/><br/>Tulchinsky and Simon know that the Messiah is dangerously low on both life-support and remaining propellant fuel. It is not likely they can get into the cargo bay, or properly maneuver the Messiah for a second landing on the comet surface... much less get back off the surface once the warheads are planted.<br/><br/>Fish\\'s silence and grim expression, however, show that none of these are factors in his plan. It is a suicide mission; the Messiah making a kamikaze run into the comet\\'s interior and detonating the warheads. All of the crew will perish. The crew is grim at this reality, but all quickly accept their pending fate. The Messiah finally gets close enough to Earth to raise Houston Mission Control on audio. Fish briefly fills Hefter in and tells him to get the arming codes for the remaining nuclear warheads.<br/><br/>At the MSNBC news offices, final evacuations are underway. There are seven people left in Caley\\'s news team... and the last helicopter only has room for seven. As one of these must be the pilot, one of the news crew must be left behind for the helicopter to drop the others off on high ground in West Virginia before transporting Jenny to the Ark. Without any proper alternative means of deciding who must be left behind, straws are drawn. Beth draws the short stick, and quietly picks up her preschool-aged daughter, hoping for the best on the roads.<br/><br/>Leo has acquired a bicycle and arrives at the Hotchner house. The Hotchner family has evacuated, leaving their dog behind. Rushing to the garage, Leo manages to locate the key to unlock the motorbike. He takes it to search the highways to find Sarah. The panicked rush to get out of the city has brought traffic to a near standstill reaching for miles.<br/><br/>The news crew is rushing to board the helicopter. Jenny pauses to grab something from her desk. As she hurries to rejoin the remaining crew, they pass by the nursery. Beth is sitting there with her daughter Caitlin. Beth has realized the likelihood of successfully getting out of danger was very low with the frantic rush. She has resigned herself to her fate and gone to the nursery, hoping to spend her last few minutes holding and playing with Caitlin, despite assuring Caitlin that they will be safe. Despite the frantic shouts of the other crew, Jenny simply stares at Beth for a long minute. Suddenly she grabs Caitlin out of Beth\\'s arms and runs madly for the helicopter. Beth rushes in anguish after her.<br/><br/>On the roof, Jenny thrusts Caitlin back into her mother\\'s arms and announces that Beth is getting on the helicopter in Jenny\\'s place. Nobody can dissuade her from this; she refuses to let Caitlin and Beth die. Everyone stares in amazement, knowing that Jenny is giving up her very life... but they have no time to debate the issue. Beth and Caitlin are ushered aboard the helicopter and it takes off, leaving Jenny behind. As she stands alone on the rooftop, Jenny gazes at what she took from her desk... it\\'s the photos Jason gave her.<br/><br/>Racing down the highway, Leo continues his search for Sarah. It is she and her parents who spot him first, calling out to him and honking. Chuck decides this time there will be no further arguing. He half carries, half-drags Sarah over to the motorbike, physically picking her up and putting her on the seat behind Leo. He puts a motorcycle helmet on Sarah\\'s head as Vicky works feverishly to attach a baby harness to Sarah\\'s chest and slip the baby into it. Chuck tells Leo to hurry off and save himself, Sarah and the baby, getting to high ground. This time he and Vicky turn a deaf ear to Sarah\\'s anguished cries of protest. As Leo races off, Vicky bursts into tears and Chuck hugs her.<br/><br/>Jenny, meanwhile, is shown pulling up to a beach side house... her family\\'s house. She knows that Jason has gone here to spend his last moments before the tsunami strikes. She finds him on the beach, calmly staring out at the ocean. Saying that she lied to Jason about not remembering the day the photos were taken, Jenny finally makes peace and reconciles with her father. She hugs him and snuggles close, still frightened of her own impending death despite the decision she made to give her life up.<br/><br/>Time has run out. The Beiderman comet fragment breaks Earth\\'s atmosphere and rushes for impact. Everyone for miles can see it race out past the coastline before it plunges deep into the Atlantic Ocean. A titanic mushroom cloud roars upward and outward from the point of impact. The skies turn dark; birds tossed helplessly about in the air as the tsunami begins to race inexorably toward the eastern coast. At the Lerner beach house, Jenny gives a brief sob of fear before Jason pulls her head against his chest and closes his eyes. The tsunami strikes the coastline and begins its run of devastation. We\\'re treated to the obligatory scenario of New York City being destroyed. In the streets, hundreds of people abandon their cars, grab their things, and try to flee, but are very quickly overtaken by the tsunami. The final shot shows the city immersed underwater save for the very tops of the World Trade Center; the broken-off head of the Statue of Liberty, surrounded by cars and dead bodies, bouncing like a dropped basketball down Wall Street.<br/><br/>On the Virginia coast, people have abandoned their cars, racing about in all directions, screaming frantically in a mad rush for higher ground. A few simply stand outside their cars and wait to perish. Among them are Chuck and Vicky Hotchner, holding each other for a final moment of comfort as the tsunami approaches. Leo and Sarah are part of a small crowd that have gotten off the road, racing for higher ground among the hills.<br/><br/>The Messiah has made final preparations for their interception of the Wolf Comet. The crew members have asked for their families to be brought to the Mission Control Center in Houston so they can say final goodbyes. Baker\\'s husband and daughter, and Simon\\'s fiancée are on standby. Commander Monash\\'s wife is still en route and hasn\\'t arrived yet... and Fish\\'s two sons were on active Naval duty and couldn\\'t be reached. Accepting this, Fish gives a quiet prayer to his late wife, saying he\\'s coming home to her at last.<br/><br/>Baker and Simon say their final goodbyes tearfully. Transmission is just about to be terminated when officers come rushing to the control room with Mariette Monash in tow. She reaches the control room in the nick of time, holding her baby son, who she\\'s named Oren in her husband\\'s honor. Commander Monash, although still blind, can hear Mariette and Oren Jr. He gives them an emotional farewell as Col. Tulchinsky sets the warhead timers and Baker and Fish calculate trajectory for the final interception run. They say farewell to each other; Baker closing her eyes and Simon closing his as Captain Tanner flies the Messiah through the vent into the comet\\'s interior. The warheads detonate, shattering the Wolf comet into millions of tiny fragments. Leo, Sarah, and Sarah\\'s baby sister are among a group of several dozen people that have gotten to the top of the highest hill they could find, barely escaping the tsunami. They watch as the shattered fragments of Wolf create a firework-like light show in the sky.<br/><br/>The story closes with President Beck delivering an impassioned speech to a huge crowd in Washington D.C. sometime later, after the waters of the Atlantic Ocean have receded and settled back into the ocean basin. Acknowledging the incalculable losses of lives in America, South America, Europe and Africa, President Beck tells his people that they must remember those who died for them, and carry on with their rebuilding of the human way of life. The camera pans out for the final shot showing the U.S. Capitol building under reconstruction as the people gathered there cheer.</div></div>'}\n",

With Zion under attack, the remaining humans brace themselves up to make their tragic and heroic last stand against the enemy, and Neo makes a pivotal, game-changing decision.

The former is said to be merely asleep, whereas neural patterns of Neo are identical to those of people who are connected to the Matrix. Morpheus, dispirited after the destruction of the Nebuchadnezzar and discovering the true nature of the Prophecy at the end of the last film, starts a search for Neo within the Matrix despite him not being jacked in. Neo is in fact trapped in a limbo: a subway station named \"Mobil Avenue\" (\"Mobil\" notably being an anagram for \"Limbo\".), a transition zone between the Matrix and the Source (the Machine mainframe). At this station, Neo meets a \\'family\\' of programs (of Indian Origin). The little girl called Sati talks to Neo, saying that her father has told her Neo isn\\'t supposed to be in the station. Father tells Neo that Mobil Avenue is controlled by a program called The Trainman who, in turn, is an exile loyal only to The Merovingian. When Neo tries to board the train with the family, the Trainman refuses, and knocks him away from the train, telling Neo he makes the rules down here.<br/><br/>Seraph contacts Morpheus on behalf of the Oracle, who now resides in a different \"shell\" (see Cast, above). The Oracle informs Morpheus and Trinity of Neo being trapped in Mobil Avenue. Seraph, Morpheus, and Trinity pursue the Trainman to secure Neo\\'s release, but he escapes. Their only option now is to go to a place called Club Hel and confront the Merovingian for Neo\\'s freedom. The three fight their way from the club\\'s parking garage to the coat check station. They engage some of the Merovingian\\'s guards, who are able to walk on ceilings and walls and kill them all, gaining access to the elevator.<br/><br/>The trio force their way into a large dance hall, brandishing two guns each. The Merovingian, in a display of scornful admiration, tells them to hand over their guns and he\\'ll meet with them directly. The Merovingian demands \"the eyes of the Oracle\" in exchange for Neo\\'s release. Trinity however loses her patience and provokes a Mexican standoff in which she, Morpheus, Seraph and the Merovingian each have a gun to their heads, forcing the Merovingian to release Neo.<br/><br/>In Mobil Ave, Neo tries to leave by running through the train tunnel. When he does, he simply runs back into the station from the opposite direction. Some time later, Trinity arrives and frees Neo.<br/><br/>Troubled by new visions of the Machine City, Neo decides to visit the Oracle one last time before returning to the real world. She informs him that as the One, upon visiting the Source (the Machine mainframe), he developed a connection with it. The Matrix and the rest of the Machine world, are derived from the Source as well. Thus we learn that all of Neo\\'s abilities - both in and out of the Matrix - exist because of this connection. This is how Neo was able to stop the machines giving pursuit after the Nebuchadnezzar was destroyed, although the end result of his lack of preparation was temporary confinement in Mobil Avenue. She characterizes Smith (who is also growing in power) as his exact \"opposite\" and his \"negative\". She also elaborates upon the relationship between her and the Architect (tellingly, each of them ejects an exasperated \"Please!\" when Neo asks them about the other). She also tells Neo cryptically that \"everything that has a beginning has an end\" and warns that Smith\\'s power threatens not only the Matrix, but also the Source and eventually the Machine City. The Oracle states that the war is about to end \"one way or another.\"<br/><br/>After Neo takes leave of the Oracle, a large group of Smith clones arrive at her home. One of them, the original Smith, finds Seraph and Sati. Smith then confronts the unresisting Oracle and assimilates her, and having gained her powers of precognition, the new Smith cackles maniacally at the future he is seeing.<br/><br/>In the real world, the remaining crew of the Nebuchadnezzar and the Mjolnir (referred to by the characters as \"the Hammer\") encounter Niobe\\'s deactivated ship, the Logos and its crew (whose ordeal is portrayed in the game Enter The Matrix). They successfully reactivate the ship and begin to interrogate the now awakened Bane, who claims he has no memory of the events of the earlier battle. After contemplating his visions, Neo announces that he needs a ship to travel to the Machine City, although he cannot explain why. Roland, the Mjolnir\\'s captain refuses him but Niobe (who was told by the Oracle in Enter The Matrix that she would have to make a choice to help Neo or not), lets him take the Logos over Roland\\'s protests. Trinity decides to accompany Neo.<br/><br/>The two remaining crews plan to return to Zion, and avoid the Sentinel army by allowing Niobe to pilot the Mjolnir through a series of service tunnels, which are nearly impossible to navigate. Shortly after departure, the Mjolnir\\'s crew discover that Bane has murdered a crew member and has hidden aboard the Logos. However they are unable to double-back in order to warn Trinity and Neo. Before the Logos can depart, Bane ambushes Trinity and takes her hostage. Neo fights Bane, who reveals himself as a manifestation of Smith. During the struggle, Bane manages to blind Neo by cauterizing his eyes with a severed electric cable. As Bane appears to have the upper hand, he closes in on Neo - only to have his attack thwarted and reversed. Neo can see Smith inside Bane as a fiery form, in spite of his blindness. Neo finishes the fight by smashing Bane\\'s head with a jackhandle and releases Trinity, who pilots them towards the Machine City.<br/><br/>Niobe, with Morpheus as her co-pilot, flies the Mjolnir through the lowest tunnel system. Flying slowly and at low power to avoid detection, they make their way to Zion. One of the craft\\'s hover pads collides with the debris on the floor of the tunnel - the bang is heard by the sentinels, who immediately pursue the craft. The crew makes a valiant effort to fight them off, however, they overwhelm the ship and begin to damage it with cutting lasers. A small group of sentinels also rips off the craft\\'s communication\\'s antenna, making it impossible for them to signal Zion they\\'re coming.<br/><br/>In Zion, the defenders deploy infantry armed with rocket launchers and Armored Personnel Units in order to protect the dock from assault. The dock is breached by two giant drilling machines, Diggers, and a huge swarm of sentinels, igniting The Battle of Zion. Despite a desperate effort the APUs fail in holding the Dock and many are destroyed. In other areas of the dock, Link\\'s wife, Zee, and her partner, Charra, use a rocket launcher to fight the sentinels and Diggers. Charra manages to blow the leg off a Digger, however it uses another of it\\'s legs to stabilize itself. She is also able to disable another Digger for a short time - it is soon reactivated by more sentinels that recharge the massive machine. Zee is able to escape the sentinels, however, Charra is killed by them.<br/><br/>During the battle, Captain Mifune fails to open the gate for the approaching Mjolnir and is attacked and viciously wounded by a swarm of sentinels. With his last breath he tells Kid (who was renewing his ammunition supply at the time), to open the gate for the Mjolnir. Kid is reluctant at first, saying he did not complete the combat training needed, only for Mifune to tell him, \"Neither did I.\" The Kid suddenly finds the courage to fight through a cloud of Sentinels to the gate and open it. Just as the remaining humans are about to be overwhelmed, the Mjolnir bursts through the gate, with further Sentinels close behind. The Mjolnir\\'s EMP is fired which disables all electronic equipment in the area. The EMP destroys all the present Sentinels, but it also disables the remainder of Zion\\'s defenses. The humans are forced gather what weapons they can and fall back to the temple entrance, awaiting the next Sentinel swarm which will surely overwhelm them all.<br/><br/>Nearing the Machine City, Neo and Trinity fly over the harvesting fields where millions of humans produce energy for the city. They are attacked by the city\\'s defense system, which hurls numerous mobile bombs and Sentinels at the Logos. Neo uses the power given by his connection to the Source to destroy the incoming bombs. However, Sentinels overwhelm the ship. To evade them Trinity flies the Logos up into an electrical storm cloud. The Sentinels are disabled, but the cloud also disables the ship\\'s engines. As the ship emerges temporarily above the cloud layer, Trinity gets her only glimpse of real sunlight and blue sky. The ship then stalls and plummets back into the storm cloud as it free-falls directly toward the Machine City. Trinity attempts to ignite the engines but it is too late and the ship crashes into a machine tower. The impact of the collision fatally wounds Trinity, and she dies in Neo\\'s arms.<br/><br/>Neo emerges into the Machine City to strike a bargain with the machines, personified by the Deus Ex Machina. Neo warns the machines that Smith (who has by now assimilated every human and programme within the Matrix) is beyond the machines\\' control, and will soon assault the Source to which the Matrix is connected. He offers to help stop Smith in exchange for a ceasefire with Zion. The second wave of Sentinels in Zion instantly responds by standing down at the temple entrance. Neo openly confronts the Deus Ex Machina, a massive droid with a human child\\'s face that acts as the interface to The Source. Neo negotiates with it, saying that in exchange for a peaceful coexistence, he\\'ll destroy Smith and his clones, which have infected most of the Machine City. The Deus insists that they don\\'t need Neo\\'s assistance, to which Neo says \"If that\\'s true... then you should kill me now.\" The Deus agrees, providing a connection for Neo to enter the Matrix and confront Smith. The Deus suggests that Neo might fail - Neo says he won\\'t.<br/><br/>The city is now wholly populated by tens of thousands of Smith copies - the clone with the Oracle\\'s powers steps forth, claiming he has already foreseen his own victory. Smith\\'s clones stand by and watch while Neo and Smith square off. Fighting on the streets, through buildings and into the sky, they continually repel each other. While battling in the sky, Smith grabs Neo and plunges to the ground with him, creating a massive crater. The two continue to battle in the crater, seemingly to a standstill. Neo is eventually outmatched by Smith, who pauses to gloat that he has \"seen this [the details of his victory] before\". Describing the details aloud, he cannot remember what he was supposed to say next in his vision. Neo refuses to give up the fight, and a frustrated Smith continues his attack until Neo is too badly hurt to go on. To both Smith and Neo\\'s surprise, Smith announces \"everything that has a beginning has an end.\" Hearing the Oracle\\'s parting advice again allows Neo to understand that Smith\\'s assimilation is not total, and baits the scared Smith into assimilating him. Neo\\'s final words to Smith are, \"It was inevitable,\" quoting Smith\\'s oft-spoken admonition.<br/><br/>Smith\\'s assimilation of Neo is seemingly successful, and when the Oracle-Smith asks Neo-Smith whether it is over, he receives a nod and smile as reply. Back in the Machine city, Neo\\'s body spasms as a surge of energy enters his body through the Matrix connection. Neo is returning to the source, and starting with the Neo copy of Smith, a white light begins to rip the clones apart from the inside out. One by one, similar to the destruction of Agent Smith at the end of The Matrix, the copies are destroyed.<br/><br/>With the elimination of the Smiths, all the programs and humans that were possessed return to normal, including the Oracle. The Sentinels that were about to attack the humans withdraw from Zion. Neo, having sacrificed himself to save both the Machines and humans, is unplugged from the Matrix and his body is respectfully carried away by the Machines.<br/><br/>The Architect, upon meeting the Oracle, tells her that she \"played a very dangerous game\" by attempting to change the way the Matrix functioned. The Oracle responds by saying that she understood the risk and knew it was worth taking. She asks the Architect what will become of any humans who want to be unplugged from the Matrix, and the Architect replies that \"they will be freed.\" The Oracle asks the Architect, \"Do I have your word?\" The Architect answers \"What do you think I am? Human?\"<br/><br/>The closing shot of the film depicts a new dawn on the world of the Matrix, created by Sati. Plant life is shown in the Matrix, and for the first (and last) time the ubiquitous green tint is absent.</div></div>'}\n",

After Halliday\\'s death, a recorded message left by his avatar Anorak announces a game, granting ownership of OASIS to the first to find the Golden Easter egg within it, which is locked behind a gate requiring three keys. The contest has lured a number of \\'gunters\\', or egg hunters, and the interest of Nolan Sorrento, the CEO of Innovative Online Industries (IOI) who seeks to control OASIS himself. IOI uses a number of indentured servants and employees called \"Sixers\" to find the egg.</div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">We open in a place called \"The Stacks\", in Columbus Ohio, in the year 2045.<br/><br/>The-low-income community is filled with a number of precariously stacked trailers and vehicles, where Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) lives with his Aunt Alice (Susan Lynch), and her boyfriend Rick (Ralph Ineson).<br/><br/>With the real world in such an impoverished state and no one really caring to do anything about it, Wade finds himself like millions of people, escaping into The OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), a virtual reality world where people can enter as avatars to play video games, entertain themselves, and seek pleasures they can\\'t find so easily in the real world.<br/><br/>Created by James Halliday (Mark Rylance) and Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg) of Gregarious Games, The OASIS is a place where one can do anything and be anyone (or anything). However, like a video game, if you accumulate stuff in THE OASIS and your avatar dies, you end up losing everything. Wade\\'s avatar in this world is named Parzival, and he frequently interacts with Aech (Lena Waithe), a huge muscular mechanic, as well as the samurai Daito (Win Morisaki) and fighter Sho (Philip Zhao), although he has never met any of them in person.<br/><br/>One of Wade\\'s hobbies, is trying to decipher a contest that James Halliday created before he died. After his death, a video was sent out, telling how he had hidden an Easter egg within the Oasis. There would be three challenges to win (presided over by Halliday\\'s avatar, Anorak the all-knowing), each one having a specific key. Whomever gets all three keys and receives the egg, would inherit Halliday\\'s personal fortune of $500 billion, and gain total control over THE OASIS.<br/><br/>While many egg hunters (nicknamed \"Gunters\") have teamed up to search, Wade mostly searches on his own. Their main competition comes from Gregarious Games\\' main competition: IOI (Innovative Online Industries). Though mostly making their money off of products and other gear to allow one into THE OASIS, the company\\'s CEO Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn) wants to find the egg to increase the amount of influence and money IOI can make from the virtual world.<br/><br/>A number of persons eagerly searched for the keys, but in five years, the only thing uncovered was the first challenge: a racing game through a simulated New York City. Wade and Aech attempt go on another race through the event, but like always, no one can get past King Kong near the end of the challenge. During the race Wade is also entranced by a female racer on a bike from the film \"Akira.\" He soon finds out that this is Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), a well-known gamer and \"sixer-fixer.\"<br/><br/>Wade convinces Aech to help Art3mis repair her bike after the race. In Aech\\'s garage, Wade and Art3mis discuss Halliday and his challenge. While Wade claims he\\'d use the money to buy things, Artemis claims he\\'s really afraid to \\'zero-out\\' and lose all his stuff.<br/><br/>Art3mis\\' words stick in Wade\\'s head, and then goes to the Halliday Journals, a place in THE OASIS that is like a personal shrine to Halliday. With assistance from a mechanical Curator (Simon Pegg), Wade observes a memory in which Halliday and Morrow have a discussion about the future of their creation. Halliday claims he hates rules, and wishes they could \"just go backwards.\"<br/><br/>The next time Wade enters the first challenge, he throttles his Delorean Time Machine vehicle backwards, and uncovers a secret roadway, that leads him underneath the challenge, past Kong, and to Central Park. He then meets Anorak, who rewards him with the Copper Key, 100,000 coins, and a clue. Wade takes his newfound winnings, and goes on a shopping spree, before telling of the challenge\\'s secret to Art3mis, Aech, Daito, and Sho.<br/><br/>In his spare time, Wade ponders the clue about \"a creator who hates his own creation\" and \"a leap not taken,\" but draws a blank.<br/><br/>At IOI, a number of board members explain to Sorrento their worry now that Parzival\\'s name is on the board. However, the businessman is fairly certain there is nothing to worry about, in their quest to get more money from THE OASIS. Even so, Sorrento goes into THE OASIS, where he meets up with a bounty hunter called I-R0k (T.J. Miller). After collecting a powerful item called the Orb of Osuvox from him, Sorrento then hires I-ROk to take out Parzival.<br/><br/>Wade\\'s next visit to the Halliday Journals has him mobbed by a number of fans, until Art3mis shows up, and helps disguise him. The two then go into the Journals, and view a recording of a meeting between Halliday and Morrow before THE OASIS went live. In the memory, Halliday tells how he took a woman named Karen Underwood (Perdita Weeks) on a date, but while she wanted to go dancing, he took her to a movie instead. Kira eventually married Morrow, though Wade notes that even though she seemed to be important to both their lives, this is the only mention of her name he\\'s found in the Journals.<br/><br/>The Curator debates this, but finds the analysis to be true. Wade is rewarded with a quarter, and an invitation by Art3mis to go to The Distracted Globe, a special club that was designed by Halliday.<br/><br/>While Wade is excited to hang out with Art3mis, Aech cautions him that she may be using him, or that Art3mis could be \"a dude.\"<br/><br/>At the Distracted Globe, Art3mis leads Wade out onto a zero-g dance floor, thinking \"the leap not taken\" may be tied to having the Copper Key, AND leaping into the void. This doesn\\'t work, but during the time in zero-g, Wade begins to confess his feelings to Art3mis, eventually even telling her his real name (which happens to be overheard by i-R0k!).<br/><br/>Before the bounty hunter can strike, IOI crashes the party, attempting to assassinate Wade. He and Art3mis manage to escape, but almost at the cost of their own lives. Art3mis confesses how her father died in an IOI \"Loyalty Center,\" trying to pay off debt, and that she can\\'t afford to be distracted from trying to find the egg, and possibly stopping further harm happening to others.<br/><br/>i-R0k does more research, and soon gives Sorrento Wade\\'s full information. Per the IOI Board of Directors, Sorrento has wade\\'s avatar piped into his office. Sorrento offers Wade plenty of things, including a$25 million bonus if he helps the company find the egg. However, Wade isn\\'t swayed by the offers, and declines...but not before Sorrento confesses that he knows where Wade lives, and is going to destroy his home!<br/><br/>Wade rushes out of his secret hiding place to warn his Aunt and her boyfriend, but is too late, as the stack their home is atop explodes, and crashes to the ground! Wade next tries to contact his friends, but is knocked out by an unknown man with a face tattoo.<br/><br/>When he awakens, Wade finds himself face-to-face with Art3mis, whose real name is Samantha Cook. She and several others are headquartered not far from The Stacks and IOI. While she seems upset about a large birthmark on her face, Wade tells her that he doesn\\'t care about it. As they talk in private, Samantha suddenly thinks she may know what the first challenge\\'s clue meant!<br/><br/>Getting their friends together, the group head back to the Journals, and inquire about the films that Halliday might have taken Kira to on her date. One that stands out to Wade is \"The Shining.\" Much like the clue, it\\'s creator (author Stephen King) hated it\\'s creation.<br/><br/>The group go into the film\\'s Overlook Hotel, courtesy of the Curator. Aech braves a number of terrifying scenarios, but they question their first assumption that a particular key in the film may be what they are looking for, when they hear music coming from one of the rooms. It is here they encounter Kira, dancing with a number of zombies over a large pit.<br/><br/>Art3mis then realizes \"the leap not taken,\" was Halliday talking about not taking the step to be with Kira! Eventually, she makes her way through the zombies, and asks Kira to dance. This reveals Anorak, who then offers her The Jade Key, and the next clue.<br/><br/>The rest of the group (dubbing themselves \"the High Five\") soon get their own Jade Key, before being followed in by a hoard of Sixers, who then are set upon by the terrors of \"The Shining.\"<br/><br/>This latest revelation also reveals to Sorrento that Wade is still alive. Sending out his associate F\\'Nale Zandor (Hannah John-Kamen) to try and track down the group. She eventually finds one of Samantha\\'s associates, and trails him to her secret hideout!<br/><br/>Wade attempts to get Samantha to escape with him, but she sacrifices herself so he can get away, and alerts their friends to help him. F\\'Nale then confronts Samantha, and claims that IOI is now in possession of her \"outstnding debts,\" earning her a ticket to the one place the girl fears most: IOI\\'s Loyalty Centers.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Wade has been found and picked up by his friends. Aech (whose real name is Helen) helps him escape in a modified postal truck, where he meets Daito (real name Toshiro), and Sho (named Shoto).<br/><br/>During this time, IOI cracked the third challenge, and determined it leads to Castle Anorak, on Planet Doom in THE OASIS. It is here the final challenge is revealed: an Atari 2600 with every game ever made for the console...but only one will unlock the final key.<br/><br/>Sorrento then has the Orb of Osuvox activated, shielding the castle from anyone getting in, while a number of Loyalty Center employees (including Samanta), set explosive charges outside the front entrance of the place.<br/><br/>To save Samantha, Wade tells Aech what he recalls of Sorrento\\'s office, and they create a digital-double of the place, hijacking his online feed before he can return to the real world! Sorrento gives the group information on Samantha\\'s workstation, and they manage to get her out. However, knowing what IOI has done to the castle, she stays in the facility, and tries to find a way to undo the orb.<br/><br/>Wade and his friends then broadcast a message across the Oasis, telling of what Sorrento has done, and requesting those who believe in what\\'s right, come to Planet Doom to help them. This leads to a massive group of persons doing battle against IOI forces, as Samantha manages to bring the orb\\'s protection down.<br/><br/>Getting outside, she manages to meet up with Wade, but not before Sorrento unleashes his Mecha-Godzilla armored suit against the. Aech uses her Iron Giant persona and Daito gains control of a Gundam suit for 60 seconds, but both fail to make a dent in the massive creature. However, Samantha manages to use a Madball/bomb thrown into the head, to take down Sorrento.<br/><br/>Sorrento then goes on a mad rampage through hi facility, certain that Samantha is there. To save her, Wade kills her character in THE OASIS, and she escapes outside, soon encountering the others.<br/><br/>Back in the game, Wade and Sho manage to make it to the final challenge. As they watch one Sixer play the game \"Adventure,\" he wins...but then falls through some ice!<br/><br/>Wade claims he knows how to get the final key, when Sorrento and i-R0k show up. Sorrento makes one more offer to Wade, but threatens to unleash a weapon called \"The Cataclysm,\" that will wipe out every avatar on Planet Doom! Wade attempts to stop the madman, but he sets off the device!<br/><br/>In the aftermath, Wade finds out he is still alive. Apparently, the quarter the Curator gave him, was an Extra Life token! Wade then begins to play Adventure, and THE OASIS then begins to broadcast what he\\'s doing. Wade explains that the goal of the final challenge, is to find the hidden Easter egg in the game (which some consider to be one of the first in video game history!).<br/><br/>This reveals Anorak, and the final Crystal Key. It is at this point that IOI and their forces have found Aech and her truck. Wade calls out to anyone in the area to meet them at The Stacks.<br/><br/>In THE OASIS, he manages to unlock a large door with his keys, and is then given papers to sign...but hesitates. Wade claims this is similar to when Halliday made Morrow sign over his shares of the company. When Wade refuses to sign, Anorak becomes Halliday, and the chamber becomes Halliday\\'s childhood room.<br/><br/>The room contains a special button, that if pressed, will erase the entire OASIS. Halliday also gives Wade the Easter egg, while telling him that while the virtual world can be good from time-to-time, the real world, and interacting with real people, is just as important.<br/><br/>The group makes it to The Stacks, but not before Sorrento knocks them off-balance. He almost kills them, when he sees the glint of the Easter egg in Wade\\'s VR goggles. It is at this time that the Police arrive, and arrest Sorrento and F\\'Nale.<br/><br/>Shortly after this Ogden Morrow shows up, along with some lawyers from Gregarious Games, wanting Wade\\'s signature. However, he claims he wants to split the prize with his friends.<br/><br/>Ogden also reveals that he was the Curator, and commends Wade for his detective work.<br/><br/>In the aftermath of the contest, Ogden comes to work with them in overseeing THE OASIS (his fee: twenty-five cents). They also ban any Loyalty Centers from doing business in THE OASIS, and IOI is forced to shut them all down.<br/><br/>Taking Halliday\\'s advice to experience the real world, the group also shuts THE OASIS off on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</div></div>'}\n",

It shows some lizards on the island and after a huge explosion, we see a single unhatched egg.<br/><br/>On a fishing boat in the South Pacific Ocean workers are sorting the fish in their latest catch and the captain sees a weird mark on the radar headed towards the boat. He sounds the alarm and the boat is hit by a large &amp; mostly unseen beast. The monster proceeds to rip giant holes in the boat, which is capsized.<br/><br/>Scientist Niko \"Nick\" Tatopoulous (Matthew Broderick) is collecting earthworms in Chernobyl, Ukraine for study when a helicopter appears and a man from the U. S. State Department tells him hes being reassigned to a different project.<br/><br/>In Tahiti, a mysterious French man is interrogating an old man who was the only survivor of the attack on the Japanese fishing boat. When asked what attacked him, and when the French man shows him the flame from a cigarette lighter, he simply replies in a terrified tone \"Gojira\".<br/><br/>Nick then arrives in Panama where Colonel Hicks (Kevin Dunn) briefs him on his next assignment. He leads him to his next sample and tells him to study it. Nick doesn\\'t see the sample until he realizes he is in a depression in the ground that is actually a giant footprint. Nick runs after Hicks and starts telling him that its unbelievable and that nothing on earth can make a footprint that big. He is then introduced to his new boss, Elsie (Vicki Lewis), who says that she tried tell Hicks that this project isn\\'t really in Nick\\'s field of study. Dr. Craven (Malcome Danare) shows up and puts on a tape showing the shipwreck and the interrogation of the old man.<br/><br/>In New York City, Audrey (Maria Pitillo) is getting out of a cab with groceries for her boss and goes upstairs to the news studio. After putting the groceries down she asks her boss, Caiman (Harry Shearer) for a job as a reporter. He says no and goes to his anchor job. Audrey then puts her gum on the nose of a nearby poster of Caiman.<br/><br/>Nick and the team have been flown to Jamaica and while in a car ride to the site of another shipwreck, Elsie asks Nick some questions. We learn that he is a radiation scientist studying the abnormal growth of earthworms due to radiation, and that he had a girlfriend a long time ago. At the shipwreck, Hicks is trying to shoo reporters away when the French man who interrogated the crew member shows up and says that they are with him and are preparing a report. Hicks get rid of them eventually. Down on the beach, Nick takes a tissue sample for study.<br/><br/>In the ocean on the Eastern seaboard, 3 fishing trawlers are bringing in a day\\'s catch when the nets seem to get stuck on something. The boats then are towed underwater and all members of crew abandon ship. One of the trawlers comes back up upside-down.<br/><br/>Hicks and team hear the report about the fishing trawlers while flying back to America and Nick then concludes that it is a new species created by the nuclear tests in the French Polynesia where it was first sighted. Back in New York, Audrey and her friend Lucy (Arabella Field) and Lucy\\'s husband Victor \"Animal\" Palotti (Hank Azaria) are having dinner at a restaurant when Audrey sees Nick on TV. We learn that Audrey is Nick\\'s old girlfriend and that he had proposed to her. She\\'d turned him down and he\\'d left her.<br/><br/>Down at the docks a man is fishing when his line is taken by what he thinks is a huge fish. The beast that attacked the fishing boats surfaces and destroys the dock and proceeds into the city. When it passes the restaurant, Animal chases it with his camera and manages to get a small video of it near Grand Central Station. The monster continues to stomp through the city -- it\\'s foot nearly crushes Animal. Elsewhere down the street, Mayor Ebert (Michael Lerner) is giving a speech for re-election when the monster storms through the street. It takes gigantic strides, oblivious to the destruction it causes.<br/><br/>Hicks arrives at the city and asks for a status report, Sgt. O\\'Neal (Doug Savant) reports that the monster has disappeared. Hicks is incredulous, wondering how an animal that big could disappear so easily in Manhattan. Nick tells them that Manhattan is an island but a unique one: much of it is covered with skyscrapers, giving the creature plenty of opportunity to hide.<br/><br/>Animal\\'s video is broadcast on TV and while handing Caiman his bag, Audrey steals his ID badge. She then replaces Caiman\\'s picture with her own taking on the identity of a reporter.<br/><br/>The French man shows up again and we learn that his name is Phillipe Roache (Jean Reno). He offers the assistance of a special sector of the French government to Mayor Ebert while slyly placing a microphone on the back of his jacket collar. The mayor then goes to a meeting with Hicks and the crew with Roache and his team listening in when O\\'Neal says that finding the monster may be tough since they found the 23rd street subway station destroyed. The beast had burrowed his way through the tunnel and could be anywhere under the city. Hicks then tells O\\'Neal to block off every tunnel leaving the island effectively quarantining the island. Nick then suggests bringing the monster out with bait.<br/><br/>The bait is a large pile of fish set up near Madison Square Park. One of Roache\\'s gang plants video cameras so they can spy on the American authorities. When one of the team says that the fish trap is crazy, Roache replies \"No. Very Clever.\" The trap works and Godzilla arrives and starts eating the fish. The Army opens fire. While being fired upon, the monster escapes and proceeds to run through the city with three helicopters in pursuit. Their missile strikes are ineffective because the monster is cold-blooded and doesn\\'t give off a heat signature for the missiles to lock onto. After a missile strike intended for the monster knocks the top off of the Chrysler Building the copters switch to miniguns with ineffective results. The beast then turns from the hunted to the hunter, destroying the helicopters. He disappears again.<br/><br/>Back at the intersection, Nick takes a blood sample found on the street and then is transported to New Jersey. He enters a shop and buys about five different pregnancy tests when Audrey walks in and we learn the secret to the past. They then go back to Nick\\'s tent where Nick finds out that the monster is pregnant from the blood sample and goes to confirm it. Audrey plays a tape saying TOP SECRET on it and then takes it and leaves.<br/><br/>At a meeting we see the leaders planning to draw the beast out again this time to a more open area like Central Park when Nick presents his theory of the creature being pregnant and tries to get the others to believe him. He theorizes that the monster will create a nest like other lizards and that the fish they\\'ve been finding around the city is food for it\\'s young. Audrey prepares her report with the tape she stole. Her report goes live after being stolen by Caiman (who dubs the beast \"Godzilla\", a mispronunciation of \"Gojira\" from the tape Audrey stole) and Nick is fired for going to the press with his ideas even though he hadn\\'t. He then realizes that Audrey took the tape. After hearing this, Roache plans to leave.<br/><br/>While Nick packs up Elsie apologizes and Nick tells her to get Hicks to find the nest. While climbing into a taxi, Audrey shows up and tries to apologize, but the angry and betrayed Nick blows it off. He tells the driver to go to Newark Airport but the drivers locks the doors and drives a different way. Animal follows in a van. When Nick finally gets the driver to stop, Roache reveals himself as the driver and explains the situation. He is part of the French Secret Service and his mission is to protect his country from their own creation. Nick then figures out that Godzilla was created in the French Polynesia during the nuclear testing just like he thought. Nick agrees to help Roache find the nest because Hicks doesn\\'t want to find it. Roache drives them to a base where they prep to enter the city and Animal watches from a hole in the wall. Animal then returns home where he finds Audrey crying because she believes that Hicks not going for the nest is her fault. Animal then convinces her to help him follow Nick and Roache to find the nest. Nick and Roache\\'s team sneak back into the city disguised as US Army soldiers.<br/><br/>In Central Park, Hicks has set another trap. While traveling down a wrecked subway, Animal sets off a huge noise that awakens Godzilla and sends him to open air. He proceeds cautiously toward the fish trap but turns away. The army starts firing and Godzilla runs to the river. Though the Army thinks he\\'s escaped again, the Navy has subs waiting for him. After dodging 2 torpedoes Godzilla crashes into one of the subs and the torpedoes destroy while following him. Godzilla then goes back towards land and is hit by two more torpedoes, seemingly killed.<br/><br/>Nick and the team then discover that Godzilla has made his nest inside Madison Square Garden (MSG). They discover only 200 eggs which begin hatching. Roache\\'s team has explosive charges but they\\'re insufficient to cause any real damage to the nest. Suddenly, the eggs around them begin to hatch, releasing dozens of baby lizards. In another part of MSG, Audrey and Animal escape into the shower room and then proceed up into the vent. While shutting all the doors to lock them in the arena 2 of Roache\\'s 4 man team are killed by the babies. Nick tries to call the military to send a bomber but all the circuits are busy. Roache then tells him to get out and find help while his team holds them off. Nick cant get out and the last 2 members of Roache\\'s team are killed. Roache and Nick are trying to think of a way to contact the military when Audrey and Animal fall out of the vent. The babies then break the door down just as Audrey comes up with an idea to get a message out. They manage to get to the broadcast booth and send a message out through live TV. The military gets the message and tells them via e-mail that they have less than 6 minutes to get out. They make it to the lobby with 30 sec. to go but the lobby is jam packed with the babies. Roache then finds a way through and gets them out just before F-18s destroy the building. All the infant lizards are killed.<br/><br/>After that Audrey and Nick get back together but before they can say anything else Godzilla rises from the ruins. He sniffs one of the dead babies then glares at Nick and the others. They immediately run away to a taxi and drive away with Godzilla chasing them. After a furious chase around Midtown, Nick sees O\\'Neal and throws the cab ID to him. O\\'Neal figures out that he can use the cab ID to find the radio frequency to contact Nick. Meanwhile, Nick and the others get stuck in a tunnel with Godzilla trying to dig them out. O\\'Neal contacts them and Nick comes up with a plan to trap Godzilla in the suspension cables of the Brooklyn Bridge. They get Godzilla onto the bridge after a terrifying incident in his mouth and the beast is ensnared in the cables. Hicks orders the F-18s that blew up MSG to circle back and fire on the beast. They hit him with several missiles. Godzilla falls dead, landing right on Nick\\'s cab.<br/><br/>While the city celebrates, Caiman offers a job to Audrey because then his channel would get the exclusive, but she quits. Animal realizes that the tape he had brought to film the entire event is gone. Roache disappears, but calls Nick from a phone booth telling him goodbye and that he will send the tape after he makes a few adjustments to it. Nick then tells Animal this after Roache hangs up and Animal is furious.<br/><br/>In MSG, basketballs and towels are burning and there is fire everywhere. One egg is still unhatched and the baby hatches and roars at the camera.</div></div>'}\n",

But just as things are starting to go his way, a real piece of the sky lands on his head. Chicken Little and his band of misfit friends, Abby Mallard (a.k.a.

Leading the townsfolk to the village square, he claims that a piece of sky shaped like a stop-sign hit him in the head. However, there doesn\\'t appear to be anything there, except some acorns. Chicken Little\\'s father, Buck Cluck, assumes that maybe it was just an acorn, and that his son over-reacted. Buck apologizes for the \\'false alarm,\\' but the townsfolk are not quick to forgive Chicken Little.<br/><br/>A year later, Chicken Little is still ridiculed for his \\'false alarm.\\' At school, tries to rely on his friends Abbey Mallard (considered an \\'ugly duckling\\'), Runt of the Litter, and Fish out of Water.<br/><br/>At school, Chicken Little and his friends endure a game of Dodge Ball, before being pushed around by Foxy Loxey, and her friend, Goosey Loosey. This leads to Chicken Little accidentally pulling the fire alarm, which leads to his Father coming to take him home.<br/><br/>Chicken Little is still hurt that his Father seems let down by his previous actions, and decides to play for the school baseball team. However, his plans to make his Father proud are sidelined when Foxy Loxey becomes the team\\'s champion, leading the team to the final game of the season.<br/><br/>Chicken Little is called up to bat, but only after the roster is almost out of players. Everyone mocks Chicken Little, until he makes a surprise hit that stuns the other team. Chicken Little ends up winning the game, and it seems that his Father is finally proud of him.<br/><br/>Later that evening, Little stares up at the sky, when suddenly, a star seems to plummet into his room. After recovering from the shock, Little is terrified to see that a piece of the sky has plummeted into his room...shaped like a stop sign! Worriedly, he calls his friends over, and they realized that the object appears to mimic it\\'s environment. As Fish examines the back, a button causes the thing to hover. Fish happily jumps on it, and it flies up into the sky.<br/><br/>Little, Abbey and Runt follow Fish\\'s position to the baseball field, where suddenly, an alien spacecraft appears, out of which appear 2 alien creatures with tentacles and 3 glowing eyes. As they leave, the three enter the ship looking for Fish. Along the way, Little finds a floating orange mass of hair, that seems to sprout an eye. After walking away, the thing then sprouts 3 eyes and limbs, and secretly follows the group.<br/><br/>The group eventually finds Fish, but Runt finds something even more terrifying: a map of their galaxy, with numerous planets crossed off, except for the next one: Earth! The group then rushes to get out of the spaceship, only to encounter the tentacled creatures that then give chase.<br/><br/>The group rushes through town, intent to ring the schoolbell and warn everyone. Chicken Little manages to make it to the schoolbell, but stops when he remembers the humiliation he endured after his last false alarm. However, hearing his friends panicking as the aliens draw closer, he rings the bell. The sound causes the aliens to quickly retreat to their ship.<br/><br/>The townspeople then follow Chicken Little, Abbey and Runt back to the baseball field, only to find nothing there. Buck also arrives, and the townspeople\\'s mood about Chicken Little winning the ballgame that afternoon now turns (again) to annoyance at what seems to be another false alarm. Chicken Little tries to convince his Dad that it was real (along with his friends), but Buck admits he doesn\\'t believe him.</div></div>'}\n",

We see various scenes of members of the gang, known as the Foot Clan, stealthily stealing various items from people right under their noses. As April walks across a vacant lot at the end of the day, she stumbles on a group of thieves stealing merchandise from a van. They pin her to the ground and attempt to steal from her when, suddenly, the single light in the lot goes out and, by the time a nearby police unit arrives, the thugs have been tied up. April finds a sai lying on the ground and puts it in her purse as a mysterious pair of eyes watches her from under the lid of a manhole. The figure curses under his breath before disappearing underground.<br/><br/>Deep in the sewers, a unique silhouette introduces the main titles before four humanoid turtles wearing colored eye-bands appear, cheering in celebration. They return to their home where their master, a large rat named Splinter (voiced by <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0165159/?ref_=ttpl\">Kevin Clash</a>), asks if they were seen and recites to them the importance of their continued training as ninjas (while one of them orders out for pizza). His attempts to meditate are interrupted when one of the turtles turns on the radio and they all start partying, except for one. The turtle with the red eye-band, Raphael (voiced and acted by <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0656929/?ref_=ttpl\">Josh Pais</a>), already irritated by the loss of his sai, announces that he\\'s going out to a movie, wearing a trench coat and hat as a disguise. In the meantime, two of the turtles, Donatello (in purple, voiced by <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000397/?ref_=ttpl\">Corey Feldman</a> and acted by <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0863208/?ref_=ttpl\">Leif Tilden</a>) and Michelangelo (in orange, voiced by <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0728411/?ref_=ttpl\">Robbie Rist</a> and acted by <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0803145/?ref_=ttpl\">Michelan Sisti</a>), wait for the delivery man (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0803145/?ref_=ttpl\">Michelan Sisti</a>) and skimp out on paying full price for a 2-minute-late pizza.<br/><br/>While out, Raphael manages to trip up a couple of thugs trying to steal from an old woman. As they run into a nearby park, Raphael follows them and meets a vigilante who introduces himself as Casey Jones (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000480/?ref_=ttpl\">Elias Koteas</a>), wearing a hockey mask and armed with baseball and cricket bats. Casey and Raphael get into an argument over the proper way to deal with the thugs and fight each other instead, ending with Raphael in a garbage can and fuming over being called a freak. Casey escapes and Raphael returns to the sewers where his temper is calmed with kind words from Splinter.<br/><br/>The next day, April pays a visit to the chief of police after a report where she is criticized by Chief Sterns (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0785435/?ref_=ttpl\">Raymond Serra</a>) for putting her nose into his business regarding the supposed organized crime wave. She walks to the subway to go home and is confronted by a team of thieves dressed in concealing ninja garb. The leader (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0863208/?ref_=ttpl\">Leif Tilden</a>) slaps her across the face and tells her to keep her mouth shut about the Foot. When she tries to fight back they knock her out but are attacked by Raphael in disguise. The Foot leader comes to in time to see Raphael carrying the unconscious April down the subway tunnel and follows them. Raphael takes April to the turtle\\'s hideout, to everyone\\'s disapproval. The Foot leader peeks in through the doorway, sees the turtles, and retreats. When April wakes up, she screams at the sight of the turtles and of Splinter who proceeds to explain who they are and why they\\'re here.<br/><br/>Apparently, fifteen years prior, Splinter had been living in the sewers after being separated from his master, Hamato Yoshi, when he discovered four baby turtles that were moving around in some kind of toxic waste. He herded them to his home where they quickly grew larger, eventually walking on two feet and talking. Splinter noticed changes in himself as well, \\'particularly in intellect\\', and began training the turtles in what he knew of the martial art of ninjutsu. He gave them names, reflecting on famous Renaissance artists: Raphael (in red), Leonardo (in blue, voiced by <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0865058/?ref_=ttpl\">Brian Tochi</a> and acted by <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0286335/?ref_=ttpl\">David Forman</a>), Donatello, and Michelangelo. Each turtle also has his weapon of choice: Raphael wields two sai, Leonardo practices swordsmanship with twin ninjato, and Donatello favors the bo while Michelangelo prefers two nunchaku.<br/><br/>The turtles escort April home and spend some time with her, at the expense of some frozen pizza. When they return home, they find their lair broken into and Splinter missing. With nowhere else to go, they return sullen to April and spend the night in her apartment.<br/><br/>Danny Pennington (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0877966/?ref_=ttpl\">Michael Turney</a>), a teenage thief seen earlier in the film, is released from jail the next morning to his father, Charles (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0666256/?ref_=ttpl\">Jay Patterson</a>), as part of a deal with Chief Sterns. Since Charles is head of Channel 3 news, Sterns releases Danny on the condition that April cease her harsh coverage on the Foot. Charles stops by April\\'s apartment that morning and advises her to stop running her story before it gets her into further trouble. April, however, is more concerned about Charles discovering the turtles hiding around the apartment. Danny spots one briefly through a reflection before he and his father are ushered out. While driving home, Charles confronts Danny about stealing and when he stops in traffic Danny gets out of the car and runs away. He goes to an abandoned warehouse near the harbor which the Foot has claimed as its base of operation. Teenagers from across the city unload stolen items or play games under the watchful eye of Tatsu (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0643164/?ref_=ttpl\">Toshishiro Obata</a>, voiced by <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0566332/?ref_=ttpl\">Michael McConnohie</a>) who is second in command. A gong signals a mass meeting and everyone gathers in a large arena where their leader, Master Shredder (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0756839/?ref_=ttpl\">James Saito</a>, voiced by <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0565567/?ref_=ttpl\">David McCharen</a>), a man clad in menacing ninja armor, addresses them as his outcast children. He tells them of a new threat to their order as Splinter, tied up against a wall in the back, listens. Upon mentioning the word \\'turtles\\', Danny speaks up.<br/><br/>At April\\'s apartment, the turtles watch the news as April updates on recent thefts and sends out a personal thanks to Raphael for rescuing her. However, Raphael and Leonardo soon get into a heated argument over what to do with Splinter gone and Raphael leaves the apartment. He goes to the roof where he\\'s ambushed by an army of Foot Clan ninjas. He is thrown, unconscious, back into April\\'s apartment just after she gets home and the turtles are forced to fight. They all wind up in the antique shop below and are soon outnumberd as Tatsu arrives with reinforcements. However, Casey Jones suddenly appears, having spotted Raphael from the rooftops earlier, and helps the turtles escape through a secret doorway as the building catches fire. They escape in April\\'s van and the ninjas retreat as the shop and apartment burn to the ground. Danny watches from afar.<br/><br/>They decide to hide out at a farm that belonged to April\\'s family and everyone pitches in to make the place more livable. Raphael remains unconscious and Leonardo provides an endless vigil. April recounts what happens in a diary and draws sketches of the turtles while trying to resist the charm that Casey puts on her. Once Raphael comes to, the turtles reconcile and resume their training. Despite their absence from the city, Shredder is bent on finding them, telling Tatsu that their method of fighting reminds him of the past. While meditating, Leonardo manages to make contact with Splinter and convinces the others to join him in a seance that night. They all share a vision of Splinter who tells them how proud he is and that they have mastered training of the mind; becoming true ninjas, before disappearing. The turtles decide to return to New York to find and rescue him.<br/><br/>At the Foot Clan warehouse, Danny discovers Splinter who detects Danny\\'s confusion and angst and speaks to him. He offers Danny guidance and advice during their short conversations, telling him once that \\'all fathers care for their sons\\', despite Danny\\'s anger towards his father.<br/><br/>The turtles return to their lair and find Danny hiding out in a closet. He tells April he ran away from his father but will go back to him if he could just spend the night. Everyone agrees to let him stay and April shows and gives him one of the drawings she did of the turtles. During the middle of the night, Danny abruptly leaves, but not before drawing the attention of Casey, who follows him. They go to the Foot Clan hideout where Danny, confused, seeks out Splinter while Casey knocks out a Foot ninja and steals his outfit.<br/><br/>Danny goes to Splinter who tells him of his time living in Japan with his master Yoshi. Splinter imitated his master\\'s practices of ninjutsu, in which Yoshi competed with a man named Oroku Saki. Both men also competed for the love of a woman named Yang Chin, but Chin loved only Yoshi and, instead of seeing him fight for her hand, convinced him to flee with her to America. However, Saki followed them and quickly dispensed them both in a rage. Splinter escaped from his cage and leapt at Saki\\'s face, scarring it. Saki swung at Splinter, slicing part of his ear, before disappearing. Danny asks what became of Saki to which Splinter replies that no one truly knows, but Danny wears his emblem on his head band. Shredder discovers the two, asking where Danny\\'s been before removing the drawing from his back pocket. He angrily walks away to gather his forces and tells Tatsu to kill \\'the rat\\'. Hearing this, Danny rushes back where he runs into Casey and explains that they have to rescue Splinter. They manage to get him out of his chains but are stopped by Tatsu and a team of ninjas.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Foot sets out to ambush the turtles in their hideout but are surprised by a sneak attack. The turtles fiercely fight back and bring the conflict to the streets above where they eventually wind up on a rooftop. As they fight, Casey engages Tatsu in one on one combat and manages to overpower him. Before leaving, he questions the gang members on their idea of this so-called family that they\\'re a part of.<br/><br/>After dispatching a few remaining ninjas, the turtles are surprised by the sudden appearance of Shredder who engages the turtles in combat, but they prove to be no match for him. When the turtles ask about Splinter, Shredder mocks them and implies that Splinter is dead. Furious, Leonardo rushes him only to be pinned. The other turtles are forced to throw down their weapons. Before another blow can be struck, Spinter appears on the roof and speaks out to Shredder, addressing him as Oroku Saki. Shredder charges Splinter with a yari but is flipped over the roof by Splinter\\'s quick movements, using one of Michelangelo\\'s discarded nunchaku. Using the coil of the nunchaku, Splinter holds Shredder by his yari precariously over the edge of the roof. When Shredder throws a knife at him, Splinter releases his grip, causing Shredder to fall into the compactor of a garbage truck. Casey casually flips a switch and the hydraulic door closes, crushing Shredder\\'s mask.<br/><br/>The turtles reunite with Splinter as police arrive on the scene and question the remaining Foot members who reveal where all the stolen goods are kept. April prepares to run a final update on the story when news crews arrive and gives Casey a celebratory kiss. The turtles cheer and exchange slang exclamations before Splinter says that his favorite has always been \\'cowabunga\\'. The turltes unanimously agree and cheer as Splinter laughs, saying he \\'made a funny\\', and the film ends.</div></div>'}\n",

Bruce Banner (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0001570/?ref_=ttpl\">Edward Norton</a>) and Betty Ross (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000239/?ref_=ttpl\">Liv Tyler</a>) were scientists working on a project involving making the body resistant to certain types of radiation, specifically gamma rays (the most harmful kind, lead sheets required). However, something went wrong, and through Banners or the Hulks, rather eyes we see him destroying the lab, killing some other scientists, injuring the project overseer, General Thaddeus Thunderbolt Ross (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000458/?ref_=ttpl\">William Hurt</a>), and rendering Betty, Ross\\'s daughter, of course unconscious. A little later, we see Bruce at the bedside of Betty, who is wavering in and out of consciousness, when suddenly Ross is there with his arm in a sling, screaming at Bruce. Bruce flees, and the hunt begins as Ross tracks down every possible lead he can find on the location of Banner and what lies within him<br/><br/>158 DAYS WITHOUT INCIDENT<br/><br/>In a town in Brazil, Bruce wakes up from a nightmare of everything that\\'s happened to him. He groans and goes about his morning routine, which includes feeding his dog Rick and learning Portuguese by watching Sesame Street and comparing what he hears to a Portuguese-English dictionary. He also spends time learning relaxation techniques in an effort to control his heart-rate and keep himself from becoming too excited. He goes to his job as a day laborer at a local factory, handing out dry goods and cleaning up messes while avoiding the old tough guys at a bottling factory. He also occasionally helps out with the electrical aspects when something breaks, which it does today. As hes fixing it and joking around with the manager, he cuts himself on a metal clip and the blood falls through all the grated floors onto the belt, and Bruce freaks out, yelling for the belt to stop. Confused, the workers stop the belt and Bruce inspects the area where the blood fell, cleaning it up and giving it the okay. As the belt starts and people start talking about the crazy gringo, no one notices the drop of blood that fell into a bottle currently destined for the United States of America.<br/><br/>Unaware of the contaminated bottle, Bruce starts to leave, but notices the same toughs who usually give him a hard time coming on to an attractive co-worker, Martina (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm2585808/?ref_=ttpl\">Débora Nascimento</a>). Bruce stops the action by asking Martina if shed like to have lunch with him tomorrow, but the leader of the gang starts coming up to Bruce, who cautions him in Portuguese by saying, Don\\'t make me hungry. you wouldn\\'t like me when I\\'m hungry. Confused, Bruce goes over this just as the manager pops up, enabling him to escape a beating and head for home, stopping along the way to pick up a package from someone. Once there, Bruce boots up his homemade computer and makes contact with someone named Mr. Blue in America. Together, the two of them are working on a cure to Bruce\\'s little problem, and after dicing up the package of a flower and applying its juice to his blood, Bruce regretfully types, No change, to which Blue types that he should come to New York and get more date contamination levels, exposure rates, types and amounts of radiation, the works. He glances at a photo of Betty he keeps before regretfully saying that he can\\'t do that either and powering down for the night.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, at the Pentagon, Ross is receiving a report from his chief assistant, Major Kathleen Sparr (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0127680/?ref_=ttpl\">Christina Cabot</a>) that an old man in Ohio died after receiving gamma poisoning from his fruit drink that came from Brazil (note the man is <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0498278/?ref_=ttpl\">Stan Lee</a>, Marvel creator). Ross quickly orders a team down there the next day, put together with no small amount of efficiency by his old army friend General Joseph Greller (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0579795/?ref_=ttpl\">Peter Mensah</a>). The team is headed up by the Russian-born but America-trained Emil Blonsky (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000619/?ref_=ttpl\">Tim Roth</a>). Ross informs them all that their target is a scientist who has stolen military secrets and that he will definitely be a fighter if cornered.<br/><br/>As they fly down to Brazil, Bruce gets a message from Blue saying that he may have success, but needs Bruce\\'s blood to be sure, which Bruce reluctantly -- and carefully -- sends off to him. That night, Bruce is sleeping soundly when Rick starts barking. Meanwhile, the commandos have taken up position outside and are scanning the room with a camera, which Rick promptly eats (or tries to). Disgusted, the commandos blow off the door and after tranqing the dog, fire a dozen tranquilizers at a sleeping Banner. They whip the covers off and see that it\\'s just pillows. They hit the street after finding a rope, getting a little ahead of Bruce, who is hiding in the apartment of Martina just below him. After giving them a few minutes, Bruce hits the ground but is immediately spotted by Blonsky. He breaks for it, going across rooftops and up the sides of buildings, at one point narrowly missing running right into a too-shocked-to-move Ross\\'s arms.<br/><br/>As he\\'s running, he manages to crash into some people that turn out to be the gang from the factory. They join in on the chase, and Bruce ducks into the factory to lose them all, but unfortunately, the gang sees the chain swinging and the troops see the gang. The gang catches up with Bruce and starts pummeling him, ripping off his backpack and tossing it aside as he begs them to stop before his heart-rate gets too high, getting out in Portuguese, \"Me....angry....very bad...\" The leader laughs and moves in for the kill while the troops near the fight, but suddenly Bruce\\'s eyes flash green just as a dart hits one of the toughs. They blame Bruce and start in again, but suddenly the leader is thrown a hundred feet through walls and the other men are screaming. The troops can\\'t make out what\\'s happening, but Ross hears the audio feed and begins yelling at them to shoot, go live, do SOMETHING! They switch to live rounds as the last of the gangers is finished and the creature turns to leave, smashing his way out with a big vat of something. The troops open fire, but the bullets just bounce off of him like plastic. The creature roars and starts in on them as Blonsky tries to get in a higher position for a better view and shot. He finds it just as the last soldier is finished. He takes his shot, and the creature notices him. A shadow passes, and suddenly Blonsky is face-to-face with the Hulk. Hulk picks up another vat and slams it down, and Blonsky goes flying as Hulk heads for the jungle, pausing only to give a victory roar. Hours later, Ross and Sparr are going through Banner\\'s apartment and computer when Blonsky comes in, demanding an explanation for what he saw out there. Ross just says that he did a good job, and he should tell his men to pack up, since they\\'re leaving town<br/><br/>1 DAY WITHOUT INCIDENT<br/><br/>Bruce wakes up beside a waterfall, not quite sure where he is, his pants hanging off of him and torn. He hears a truck and heads for the road, where the driver tells him he\\'s in Guatemala. The driver takes Bruce into town, where Bruce proceeds to work his way north and pick up some new clothing while in Mexico.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Blonsky has finally succeeded in wearing down Ross enough to tell him what went on. Ross explains that back in World War II, there were a lot of special programs being worked on to give America the edge, almost all of them under an Infantry Weapons Development program. One of them was a program for bio-tech force enhancement, more commonly known as \"Super Soldier\". About five years ago, Ross dusted off that program and began trying to put it together again. He recruited Banner and his team to work on it, but then something went very wrong....or very right, depending on how you look at it. In either case, the end result, according to Ross, is that Bruce Banner\\'s whole body is now, in his opinion, the exclusive property of the U.S. Government. The two men sit there and after an exchange about how they\\'re both fighters, Blonsky says that if he could put what he knows now in his body twenty years ago, that would be someone he wouldn\\'t want to fight. Ross smiles grimly and says, \"I could probably arrange something like that.\" Blonsky merely stares up at him, intrigued.<br/><br/>17 DAYS WITHOUT INCIDENT<br/><br/>At Culver University in Virginia, we see Bruce heading for the old science department where Hulk was born. However, the appearance of security guards checking IDs puts the kibosh on those plans. Deterred, he heads outside and sees the building housing all science teachers, and who should come out but Betty, chatting amiably with a friend of hers. He stares at her stupidly as she eats outside, and she looks up towards him and smiles. He ducks behind a tree (yeah, that\\'ll work), but she was actually smiling at her newly arrived boyfriend, Leonard Samson (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0123092/?ref_=ttpl\">Ty Burrell</a>), psychologist extraordinaire. Now deterred and defeated, he heads to an old on-campus pizza parlor where the owner, Stanley (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0813015/?ref_=ttpl\">Paul Soles</a>), is an old friend of his. Bruce asks about Samson (insert envy joke here), and then asks for two more things -- a place to stay for a few days, and a job. The very next day we see him delivering pizzas in his old uniform, and one of the stops happens to be the science lab. He talks to the guard (Lou Ferrigno, Hulk from the TV series) and is able to get upstairs, where after bribing the head computer genius with a pizza he gets on one of the computers to look for the data on his experiment, but it\\'s all gone. Bruce contacts Blue and tells him the bad news, and then gets out of there.<br/><br/>That night, Bruce is getting ready to leave and Stanley is getting ready to close up when two final customers come in.....Betty and Samson. They begin chatting with Stanley as an unaware Bruce comes down the stairs. Just as Stan consents to make them a pizza Bruce opens the kitchen door and sees Betty, who sees him. Her mouth opens in shock, but when she looks again Bruce has taken off. She runs outside but doesn\\'t see him hiding behind the dumpster, and once back inside she bullies Stanley into spilling the truth. A while later, we see Bruce walking in the rain on a highway when Betty pulls up behind him. He sees her and she runs to him, begging him not to go. Soon they are pulling into the house she shares with Samson, and she reveals a present she kept for him -- all the data from their experiment on a nice little portable drive. He tells her that he can\\'t stay, but accepts her offer of money and a ride to the bus station the next morning. Meanwhile, Ross is pulling a serum out of cold storage and prepping Blonsky for injection, which he warns will hurt. For his part, Blonsky just grits his teeth and tells them to get on with it.<br/><br/>The next day, Bruce and Betty are walking through the college campus to the bus station when Betty pauses to fix Bruce\\'s shirt, making him more fashionable. As she does, he sees a soldier move behind a column of one building and tells her to get as far away from him as she can. He bolts and as the soldiers move in, she looks around for the command vehicle and convinces Ross to come out, begging for him to stop. He ignores her request and orders the rest of the team in. Bruce ducks into a library and removes his pack. He fishes out the drive and forces it down his throat before moving on. However, the pause has caused the soldiers to catch up to him, and they trap him in an overpass as Blonsky moves in. They fire two canisters of knockout gas into the bridge, but Banner transforms and leaps out. He begins fighting the soldiers, leaping all around them and crushing their vehicles, but Blonsky moves in and leaps around Hulk like a mosquito, peppering him with rounds from a grenade launcher. He gets Hulk to follow him into the path of two sonic blasters which pepper Hulk with sound-waves, but unfortunately, Hulk sees Betty crying out and manages to take them apart using two parts of a nearby sculpture. Blonsky gets pissed and approaches Hulk, and proceeds to get slammed into a tree breaking every bone in his body. Ross orders in a helicopter just as Betty runs towards Hulk. Hulk throws part of the statue at the chipper, which crashes and makes a huge inferno that envelops Hulk, who envelops Betty and keeps her safe from it, though she does go unconscious again. Hulk looks at Betty and sees Ross standing there with Sparr. He snarls at Ross, turns, and heads off. Later, we see Ross\\'s boys taking everything Betty owned out of her house as Ross tells Samson that he did the right thing by calling Ross. In turn, Samson calls Ross the bigger threat, since Hulk protected Betty whereas Ross endangered her. Ross says that her safety is his utmost concern, but Samson says that his best feature is that he always knows when someone is lying, and that he also knows now why Betty never talked about him.<br/><br/>That night, in the North Carolina stretch of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Betty wakes up in a cave to the sound of a thunderstorm. She sees Hulk staring down at her curiously and screams. He jumps and hits his head on the ceiling of the cave, but she calms him down. Suddenly, lightning strikes and Hulk screams at it, throwing a rock into the sky at this new challenger. Betty again calms him down, reassuring him as a mother would her frightened child, and eventually, he goes to sleep. The next morning, she and Bruce wake up and drive into town, where Betty gets them a motel room and Bruce takes a shower and coughs up the data chip. Betty gets him some new clothes and together they get a used car with cash obtained from the pawning of her mother\\'s old necklace. As she\\'s paying, though, Bruce uses a public computer to send the data to Mr. Blue, aka Samuel Sterns, at his Empire State University email address. Even worse, Ross\\'s team, with the help of the Strategic Homeland Infiltration, Enforcement, and Logistics Division (S.H.I.E.L.D.), is able to capture this email and figure out where they\\'re heading.....Empire State University. Meanwhile, Ross is checking on Blonsky, who had previously had more broken bits than the Titanic, and is shocked when Sparr shows him a fully-healed Blonsky, who is \"pissed off and ready for round three.\"<br/><br/>Back with Betty and Bruce, we see them heading for New York when Betty asks what it\\'s like when he changes. The best Bruce can answer is that everything is a lot more amplified. Betty points out that there\\'s still something of him in there, using the recognition of her as evidence, so maybe if Bruce could control it -- but Bruce interrupts her, saying that he wants to get rid of it. The next day, the pair are in line at the Verrazano-Narrows bridge when Bruce notices a police checkpoint. They get out, sneak around the back of the truck, and head down to the docks, where after one boat ride they find themselves in the city and get a cab to ESU, which turns out to be the most frightening ride ever and has Betty screaming obscenities at the lascivious cabbie. As he pulls away, our pair have this exchange:<br/><br/>Bruce: \"You know, I could show you some techniques to manage that rage a little better...\"\\nBetty: \"Don\\'t start!\"<br/><br/>Eventually, the pair get to ESU (with no cabbie murders) and meet the small, quiet, and an unassuming young man known as Samuel Sterns (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0625789/?ref_=ttpl\">Tim Blake Nelson</a>). Being thrilled to meet both of them, he brings them up to his lab and they immediately start talking, where he warns that if they miscalculate too high, the dose could kill Bruce. In turn, Bruce warns that if the dose is too low, it could be dangerous to Sterns, though Sterns just laughs this off, clearly not believing him (though who could, really?). Regardless, they set about recreating the experiment with little trouble (student-used computers at fault). They manage to draw Hulk out and inject the antidote as Betty struggles to keep Hulk from lashing out. The antidote takes effect, and Hulk reverts back to a hyperventilating Bruce. Meanwhile, on a military base, we see soldiers prepping for moving out while in a locker room, Blonsky examines himself in a mirror. Unnoticed, his spine elongates and extends out from his body the slightest bit. He boards the chopper and Ross asks him how he feels, and he declares, \"Like a monster.\"<br/><br/>In the lab, Sterns is proposing his latest theory that what they injected Bruce with was just for the suppression of that one episode. He starts to talk about his subjects, which causes Betty and Bruce to stare at him in horror and ask, \"What subjects?\" He smiles gleefully and shows them a room with tons of distorted fetuses and dozens of synthesized bags of Bruce\\'s blood, all of which Sterns was able to make from that one sample Bruce sent. Bruce and Betty tell him that they need to destroy all of it, but Sterns can only see a future Nobel Prize. Bruce starts to become agitated, but a sniper suddenly tags him from outside just as Blonsky rushes in and knocks him out, shoving Betty aside roughly. A team takes Bruce out as Sparr stays behind to supervise cleanup, but as they do and as Betty storms onto a waiting chopper and away from the man she no longer wants to call her father, Ross whispers to Bruce just before he gets loaded on, \"If you took it from me I\\'ll put you in a hole for the rest of your natural life.\"<br/><br/>Back on the ground, Sparr is interrogating Sterns when she gets knocked out from behind by Blonsky. Sterns is terrified, but then Blonsky says that he wants Sterns to turn him into what Bruce turns into. Sterns is eager to oblige for reasons that have nothing to do with Blonsky\\'s threats, but he does warn Blonsky that the result, thanks to what Blonsky already has in him, could be an abomination. Blonsky lifts Sterns to the ceiling and says that that counts as informed consent, and the ball starts rolling. As Betty and Bruce share a moment in the chopper, Sterns procedure takes hold, and Blonsky -- now the Abomination -- smashes the whole lab, spilling chemicals on Sterns, whose head bubbles weirdly and begins to grow larger and flatter as he grins. Blonsky leaps outside and starts tearing up the streets and soldiers left there, and one of the soldiers gets a message off to Ross that, \"The Hulk is loose!\" Ross glances at Banner, who appears just as shocked, and says that\\'s impossible. They manage to get a visual on-screen, and they see the Abomination tearing apart the city. Bruce realizes that only one thing can stop that and Ross agrees. They move over the site and open the back door. Betty begs Bruce not to do it saying that they don\\'t know if he\\'ll change, but he says he has to try. They kiss each other, and then he allows himself to fall backward. He passes the level of buildings, and manages to say, \"Oh, shi--\"<br/><br/>SMASH!!!<br/><br/>A huge hole appears in the middle of the pavement, down the street from the Abomination. The Hulk slowly pulls himself from the hole and roars. Blonsky hears and grins, and the two monsters run toward each other. They leap and collide in mid-air, with Blonsky carrying the way, dazing Hulk slightly and punching him down the street. Hulk shakes it off and tears a police car in two and launches it at the Abomination. Blonsky takes the hit and then unleashes one of his own, punching Hulk through a building and way downtown. The Abomination roars in delight and chases after him, climbing up and over buildings to catch up as Ross orders the chopper gunner to open fire on Blonsky. Blonsky barely avoids all of the bullets and catches up to Hulk, pummeling him some more before deciding to grab hold of the copter. Hulk sees this and then sees Betty in there, roars, and grabs hold of Blonsky, creating a copter-Abomination-Hulk chain. The pilot says that it\\'s too much weight and he has to put her down while Hulk and Abomination continue their battle on the landing struts. The battling becomes too much, and the chopper finally crashes near a construction site (always the way...). As Betty and Ross pull themselves from the wreckage, Blonsky keeps beating on Hulk. Suddenly, a spark from the main rotor hits a gas puddle below the chopper. Hulk sees this happening, becomes angrier and bigger, and manages to shove the Abomination aside just in time to create a sonic boom that puts out the fire by creating a limited vacuum. Meanwhile, the Abomination has found a huge chain that just happens to have two mace-like attachments on the end and is swinging it at Hulk merrily. Hulk manages to get under it, get a hold of the chain, and wrap it around Blonsky\\'s neck. He pulls it tight, and Blonsky goes unconscious. He pulls it tighter, determined to kill the source of his hurt and pain when Betty cries out, \"Stop!\" Hulk sees her and calms and obeys. The Abomination is still out, so Hulk tosses him to land at the feet of Ross before letting loose with another victory roar. He quiets, and for a moment, all is still. No one moves as the Hulk gazes distrustfully at all the little people with loud guns around him when suddenly a second chopper appears with a searchlight blaring. Hulk roars in frustration and takes to the roofs again, running off. He reaches the coastline, and...<br/><br/>A few days later, we see Betty on Liberty Island, looking sad as she stares up at the big green woman. A beep sounds from her pocket and she pulls out a camera she had gotten while on the run with Bruce to see a picture of him not-quite-smiling back at her beneath the words \"low battery\". The camera suddenly powers down, and Betty sighs, saddened by the loss of the one proof she had of their time together...<br/><br/>31 DAYS WITHOUT INCIDENT<br/><br/>In Bella Coola, British Columbia, we see a shack set up deep in the mountains. Inside, we see Bruce addressing an envelope to Betty. When he\\'s finished, he opens the flap and puts her mother\\'s necklace inside, making sure to not be rough with it. That done, he sits down and meditates, thinking about what everyone told him about control. He closes his eyes, breathes deeply, and opens them again...<br/><br/>They are glowing green.<br/><br/>On a black screen, we hear General Ross saying Reload. We find him sitting in an ordinary bar in an ordinary city uniform undone. The bartender refills his drink as the door opens. Tony Stark (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000375/?ref_=ttpl\">Robert Downey Jr.</a>) enters and sidles up to Ross, offering his condolences on failing to capture Banner and losing control of Blonsky and saying that he did warn Ross against pursuing the Super Soldier program since it was shut down for a reason. Ross sighs and acknowledges Stark, saying that he always wears the nicest suits, to which Stark smiles and says, \"Touché.\" Stark says that he heard that Ross had an interesting problem, and Ross responds by saying, \"Well, you\\'d know all about that, wouldn\\'t you?\" Not to be outdone, Stark follows up with, \"We\\'re putting a little team together. Thought you might be interested.\" Finally, letting his curiosity override his caution, Ross says, \"Who\\'s we?\"</div></div>'}\n",

The film opens to a child reading a comic book about the Daily Planet, the largest newspaper in the city of Metropolis. As the child reads, the shot dissolves to the real Daily Planet and up into the sky. The following title sequence moves through space and eventually reveals the planet Krypton, the home world of a highly-evolved race resembling humans and bearing a unique molecular density and structure, a result of the planet\\'s gravitational strength and the radiation of its adjacent red sun. The planet is ruled by a Council of Elders, each representing a particular \"clan\" and bearing a crest of that particular House. The planet\\'s greatest scientist, Jor-El, bears an S-shaped crest, the House of El. He is supervising the trial of three criminals caught attempting to overthrow the planet\\'s government: General Zod, the planet\\'s former defense chief; his henchman Non, a hulking killer unable to speak; and Ursa, a woman determined to exterminate men other than the man she loves: Zod. As the elders render a guilty verdict, Zod notes that the verdict must be unanimous, so Jor-El ultimately holds the key to their fate. Despite his disillusionment with the Council of Elders, Jor-El renders a conviction. The vast dome of the planet\\'s capital city opens to the night, and a small extra-dimensional prison - the Phantom Zone - tumbles out of the sky and pulls the three criminals out of the trial room and into an eternity in dimensional limbo through space. While a frightened Ursa begs for forgiveness, Zod defiantly swears that he will have his vengeance on the House of El, even if it takes him a thousand years.<br/><br/>However, Jor-El\\'s more pressing concern lies in the orbital shift of Krypton; this shift is putting the planet into the fatal gravitational pull of its central star, a fact blithely ignored by the Council Of Elders. The leader of the Council forbids Jor-El from warning the larger populace or he will be imprisoned in the Phantom Zone himself. Jor-El promises to be silent and that he and his wife will not attempt to leave the planet. Jor-El chooses instead to construct a crystalline starship for his infant son Kal-El. Jor-El\\'s wife Lara, however, is concerned, for the starship is programmed to take the child through a trans-galactic warp to a planet populated by primitive humans whose technological development is millennia behind Krypton, a planet that orbits a yellow sun, a planet called Earth. Jor-El, however, understands that the planet\\'s yellow sun will give Kal-El superhuman powers, which will give him the advantage he needs to survive. Jor-El and Lara bid their child goodbye before Joe-El installs a green crystal into the ship, a crystal containing the very essence of himself and Lara as well as the knowledge of the entire universe. He then completes the assembly of the starship - just as the planet is pulled into a fatal plunge toward its red sun. The starship is launched and escapes the system scant minutes before the planet is torn open, collides with its central star, and both bodies are obliterated in a holocaust of fire and debris.<br/><br/>The tiny starship passes the Phantom Zone before accelerating on its journey to the planet Earth, with the voice of Jor-El providing the infant, who is aging as the ship proceeds, with knowledge. The ship finally reaches Earth in the year 1951 A.D. and plunges like a meteor into a vast wheat field near Smallville, Kansas - within sight of local farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent. Upon seeing the meteor the Kents discover the now-three-year-old Kal-El. Martha, believing the child is a gift from God, decides to adopt him. The child demonstrates that he is different when, as Jonathan is changing a tire on his truck and the jack slips, he innocently lifts the vehicle with his bare hands, saving his foster father\\'s life.<br/><br/>After the truck is thus repaired the Kents and their newly adopted son drive away, leaving the meteor behind - but as its energy fades out it is clear it will become significant to the Kents in due time.<br/><br/>Some fifteen years pass and Clark, named for Martha\\'s maiden name, is a student at Smallville High School. He is a water boy on the school\\'s football team, and friends with cheerleader Lana Lang, but is frequently bulled by Lana\\'s jock boyfriend, Brad Wilson. Clark knows of the vast power he possesses but is forbidden by his father from showing it - although, alone on a football field, he kicks a ball into orbit, then runs home by outrunning a speeding passenger train, and is seen by a young girl who tries to tell her parents; her mother, however, scolds young \"Lois Lane\" about telling tall tales.<br/><br/>Clark returns home as Brad, Lana, and other students drive by, surprised that he arrived home so quickly. Jonathan, however, reassures Clark that he is on Earth for a reason and that he should not let others bother him. Clark thus feels better, but as he starts to play with the family dog, Jonathan suddenly stops, having lost feeling in his left arm. He then falls to the ground, victim of a heart attack. After Jonathan\\'s burial the grieving Clark blames himself, \"All those powers, and I couldn\\'t even save him!\".<br/><br/>Some time later Clark is awakened early one morning by a mysterious noise, emanating from the barn. Clark enters the barn and finds the remains of the meteor, and with it the now-activated green crystal of Jor-El. Later that morning, Clark tells his mother that he must leave and head north. Martha, having known this day would come, urges her son to always remember her, and the tearful Clark vows to do just that as they embrace for one final time.<br/><br/>Days later Clark reaches the North Pole, where he takes the green crystal and throws it miles into the distance, where it melts into the ice and begins construction of a gigantic crystalline fortress, a Fortress of Solitude. Inside Clark finds a matrix table of crystals; placing one into an aperture, he activates a dimensional communicator that reveals the preserved consciousness of Jor-El, his true father. Jor-El provides the youth with his true identity of Kal-El and takes his son on a journey through time and space to complete his maturation, educating him on the universe and on his purpose in life. When the journey ends, Kal-El has aged twelve years to the age of 30, although in the time-twisting of inter-dimensional travel the Earth has aged 22 years to the year 1978 A.D. The scene reveals the now fully matured Kal-El dressed in a red-and-blue costume with a long red cape and bearing his family symbol, ready to fulfill his purpose of protecting his new homeworld.<br/><br/>-------------------------<br/><br/>Metropolis, the greatest city in the world. At the skyscraper home of its largest newspaper, the Daily Planet, photographer Jimmy Olsen is shooting photos of a typically kinetic day in the life of the Planet, including ace reporter Lois Lane (who despite this status has a problem with spelling, frequently being corrected for misspelled words). Lois and Jimmy are introduced by the paper\\'s grumpy editor, Perry White, to its newest member, a tall shy bespectacled news writer named Clark Kent. Lois is initially puzzled by the man\\'s shyness and mild social clumsiness, and is particularly struck when the two of them are held up in a back alley by a gunman. Clark faints when the thug opens fire on Lois (the fainting is cover so Clark can catch the bullet in his bare hand, which causes the gunman to run), and in defending himself to Lois rattles off a listing of all the items in her purse.<br/><br/>As Lois and Clark hail a taxi, walking past them is a white-dressed heavyset man munching on snacks and carrying a copy of the Planet. The man is tailed by Harry and Armis, two undercover cops, for he is Otis, an assistant for criminal genius Lex Luthor, and he is on his way to Luthor\\'s secret hideout. The cops tail him to Metropolis Grand Central Station, where Harry sends Armis to get backup while he tails Otis onto subway Track 22 leading out of the station. Otis eventually finds an indentation in the underground tunnel and waits for a train to arrive. A doorway opens under the cover of the passing train, and after it is gone Harry goes to the doorway to try and figure out how to open it - a fatal mistake, for monitoring the scene from hidden security cameras is Luthor himself, who activates the doorway and violently pushes Harry into the path of another train.<br/><br/>Luthor\\'s moll, Eve Teschmacher, is appalled by the scene, but Luthor arrogantly and condescendingly reminds her that it is an inevitable by-product of his status as the greatest criminal mind of the latter 20th century, a status to which he takes egotistical delight. He tells her how his father (a cruel man who disowned Lex as a child), once told him that even if governments and economies collapse, people will still need land, and will do anything to get it. This has guided his criminal career ever since. When Otis arrives in their underground lair he is reminded of his clumsiness in allowing himself to be followed again. Thus he is given the unglamorous task of feeding \"the babies,\" a group of unidentified unseen creatures in a vast pit used to dispatch intruders. Luthor\\'s more pressing concern, however, lies in a story in the Planet that two nuclear cruise-type missiles with hypersonic speed are to be tested using live multi-megaton warheads soon. Luthor intends to use the missile test to fulfill the greatest real estate swindle in history.<br/><br/>Later that night, Lois Lane is scheduled to fly via Planet helicopter to Metropolis International Airport to greet Air Force One, but on the Planet\\'s helipad she boards the chopper and when the chopper begins takeoff, a light cable breaks free of its bracket and in the updraft caused by the chopper snags its landing skids, breaks, and plunges the chopper out of control through the helipad\\'s control shed and crashing onto the ledge. As police hustle panicking bystanders on the streets below to safety, Lois tries to crawl out of the chopper, but the ledge begins to crack and the chopper sags violently toward the street and Lois falls through, hanging on by a seat belt in the air.<br/><br/>But amid the panic in the streets, Clark Kent emerges from the Planet and notices a yellow rain hat on the sidewalk. Upon recognizing it as one Lois was wearing, he sees the stricken chopper, and while those around him run for safey, Clark keeps his head, even while finding a suitable hiding place to change takes a bit of hunt in the vicinity. Running to another building down the street, Clark opens his shirt to reveal his emblem and then whirls through a revolving door at super speed to become effectively invisible and changes into Superman - to the awe and confusion of a nearby pimp.<br/><br/>Superman takes off, just as Lois loses her grip on the seat belt and plunges towards the street below. Superman safely catches her and carries her upward. The chopper now breaks off the ledge and falls, but Superman safely snags it out of the air with one hand and carries it back to the Planet\\'s helipad to the astonishment of the crowd below. When the awe-struck Lois asks who the stranger is, he merely replies, \"A friend.\" She faints from pure exhaustion and disbelief.<br/><br/>It is but the beginning, for Kal-El undertakes numerous feats of heroism - stopping a cat-burglar using gigantic magnets to scale the Solow Building, intercepting a boatload of bank-robbers, rescuing a cat from a tree, and rescuing Air Force One when a lighting strike shatters its portside engine and wing.<br/><br/>The next morning, he returns to the Fortress of Solitude and consults the spirit of Jor-El to convey the emotions he felt upon making his full power known. Jor-El urges him to be circumspect in his power and praises him for what he has learned so far.<br/><br/>After that busy night, Superman dominates the news about this astounding man doing his good deeds with seemingly impossible abilities. Watching the news about the stranger, Lex Luthor sees his arrival as a natural challenge, considering that Superman would surely have the inclination and the power to interfere with his scheme, and the criminal mastermind vows to destroy all that the stranger represents. Perry White, for his part, makes discovering the red-and-blue stranger the #1 priority of the Planet and sends his entire staff scurrying to find any scrap of information about \"this flying whatchamacallit.\" Lois, however, scoops everyone when she gets a note requesting a dinner date at her penthouse from \"a friend.\"<br/><br/>The dinner date takes place and as part of the interview, in which Superman astounds the cynical reporter with his sincerely kind, courteous and altruistic personality, Kal-El gives Lois a ride in the sky - a flight that becomes almost a romantic dance as the two begin falling in love. Kal-El returns Lois to her apartment and the two bid reluctant goodbye. Lois quietly dubs him a true super man - and uses the term to identify the stranger in her subsequent front-page story. Luthor reads it and remembers a scientific theory; Superman\\'s homeworld would be of a molecular construction that would be affected by the unique radiation of a yellow sun, and that meteors from Krypton upon landing on Earth would be affected to the point of emitting a radiation that would affect only Kryptonians. Such a meteorite was found in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Miss Tessmacher is skeptical, as even with \"the rock,\" Superman could see them coming from miles away. But the interview hints at another weakness: Superman has difficulty seeing through lead. With their plan in place, they plan a trip to Ethiopia.<br/><br/>Later, Luthor\\'s gang go to work intercepting the two missile convoys used for the big upcoming test; using a variety of guises, they divert attention away from the effort to reprogram the missiles\\' directional vectors; Otis, however, misprograms one of the missiles, attributing this mistake to his arm not being long enough to write down the coordinates. Luthor violently attacks him for gross incompetence, but Miss Tessmacher calms him down while keeping the car they are in from crashing.<br/><br/>The Planet learns that an unknown figure is buying up hundreds of acres of seemingly worthless desert in the southwest. Suspecting land fraud, Perry sends Lois and Jimmy to investigate. Had Clark showed more initiative and confidence, the assignment would have gone to him. As Perry shares a story about a \"worthless meteorite\" being stolen from an Ethiopian museum, Clark is struck by a piercing signal, a high pitched hum followed by the sound of every dog in Metropolis barking at once- it is Lex Luthor on a radio frequency only Superman (and the dogs) can hear. Luthor warns Superman that a poison gas pellet containing propane lithium compound is to be released into the air and kill the city\\'s population unless Superman confronts him alone. Feigning a migraine, Clark sneaks away from his co-workers and jumps out a window, where he changes into Superman mid-flight and traces Luthor\\'s signal to the street. He spins himself around and manages to drill through the ground and into Luthor\\'s hideout, where he is attacked by the hideout\\'s automated defense system - a wall of machine guns, then a wall of fire, finally a wall of liquid nitrogen that freezes the area. None has any effect on Superman, who casually walks through it all unharmed.<br/><br/>Once inside the hideout, Superman demands knowledge of Luthor\\'s gas pellet. Luthor lets the truth be known that it is a hoax, it was the only way to gain an audience with him. Luthor reveals his true plans for the stolen missiles; the first will destroy the San Andreas Fault, which will collapse the Western coastline of the US (namely California and its major cites) into the ocean and thus make the seemingly worthless desert of the west into multi-billion dollar windfalls. The second missile is designed to be a cover. Luthor boasts that nobody, not even Superman, can bring down both of them, and if necessary, he can detonate either warhead via remote. Superman notices a box made of lead which he assumes hides Luthor\\'s detonator. But when he opens it he is struck by a massive weakness, for the box contains the Ethiopian meteorite - Kryptonite, fitted to a chain necklace that Luthor drapes around him. He takes great delight in reminding Superman that despite his aura of invincibility, a normal human has found a way to beat him. Superman asks if Luthor even cares about the second missile\\'s target (the one misprogrammed by Otis) which is revealed to be Hackensack, NJ, before Luthor drops him into his pool to drown.<br/><br/>Luthor, however, has made a fatal mistake, for due to Otis\\' misprogramming, Eve Teschmacher\\'s mother lives in Hackensack. While Luthor and Otis monitor the errant missiles on their hypersonic flight, she pleads with Superman to stop the Hackensack missile first on his mission; he agrees and she frees him. Regaining his power, Superman blasts through the mammoth ceiling of the lair, into the sky, and on a direct course west. He tries to stop the first missile over Kansas but it dodges him, and he must overtake it and force it into space - just as the second missile detonates the San Andreas Fault, setting off an omnicidal quake that is like the destruction of Krypton all over again, a nightmare that doubly drives Superman as he flies underneath the Earth\\'s crust to stabilize the land.<br/><br/>However, the aftershocks prove no less deadly, and Superman flies all across the area rescuing people from the ensuing disasters. But amid his enormous feats of heroism, one person in particular needs help. Amid the aftershocks, Lois\\'s car runs out of gas in the middle of a desert, and is swallowed by a massive fissure, effectively burying her alive. Superman eventually senses she is in danger. He finds the car and pulls it out of the ground. He quickly takes Lois\\' body out of the car, but is too late. She has suffocated and died. Superman tearfully kisses her, and then lays her body down. He stands over it silently for several moments. Superman finally screams a thunderous roar of anguish and then rages into the sky. He hears the voice of Jor-El, which reminds him that he must not interfere with human history. Recalling his failure to save Jonathan (\"All those powers, and I couldn\\'t even save him\"), he becomes absolutely determined to save Lois. Pulling together all of his power and strength, Superman flies around Earth\\'s perimeter faster and faster eventually reversing the planet\\'s rotation and pulling time back with it. He soon fixes it back to its original direction and uses the extra time to get to Lois before her car is buried.<br/><br/>As revenge for her betrayal, Luthor and Otis are preparing to drop Miss Teschmacher into the pit of \"the babies.\" Superman, however, rescues her, and pointedly notes to Luthor that Miss Teschmacher\\'s mother sends her love.<br/><br/>Afterward, Superman delivers Luthor and Otis to a maximum security prison to hold them pending trial. Luthor shouts his defiance (mirroring Zod in the opening moments), but he is comically interrupted by Otis. As both men are led away by the guards, the prison warden thanks Superman for his good deeds. Superman humbly dismisses the praise as just his contribution to their mutual effort for the good of society even as he takes off into the high atmosphere to resume the patrol of his adopted home planet. Once there, Superman, happy that his self-appointed neverending battle has had a satisfying beginning, looks to the audience with a wink and a smile as he flies off for more adventures.</div></div>'}\n",

Each Japanese officer kneels in line and ceremonially commits seppuku (ritual suicide), but Yashida cannot bring himself to die immediately. As he prepares, Logan stops him. Yashida ultimately watches the bomb fall from one of the bombers, and Nagasaki is consumed by a massive fireball. Yashida tells Logan to escape, but Logan tells Yashida to climb down into the pit, as he\\'ll stand a better chance of surviving the nuclear blast below. He makes up his mind and jumps into the pit, followed by Logan. Logan grabs a metal door and covers Yashida with it. Seconds later a wall of fire sweeps into the well, and Logan is consumed by it and horrifically burned. Yashida survives the bombing with only a small burn on his cheek, and watches in horror as the third-degree burns on Logan\\'s body heal before his eyes.<br/><br/>Logan awakens in the modern day. He\\'s in bed with Jean Grey (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000463/?ref_=ttpl\">Famke Janssen</a>), and she asks him what dream it was this time. \"Nagasaki\" he responds. Logan has bad dreams every night, it seems. The two cuddle, and Logan professes his undying love for her and swears that he\\'ll never harm anyone else. Jean says, \"It\\'s too late.\" Logan is horrified to see his claws are embedded in her lower chest and fresh blood is pouring out of her stomach. Logan screams in horror, and awakens from his dream-within-a-dream in a cave in the Yukon.<br/><br/>Since Jean\\'s death when the X-Men made their last stand, Logan has lived a primitive, solitary lifestyle. It appears that he lives in the woods like a wild animal, and hasn\\'t bathed or shaved in a while. His small cave has only the basic necessities: empty whiskey bottles and an old radio which is losing battery power. Logan dresses and exits the cave, walking through the wilderness to the nearest town. Along the way he sees a bear\\'s claw mark on a tree and slashes across it with his own claws. Moments later he crosses paths with a mammoth grizzly bear who, for all appearances, is friendly with Logan. Logan comes to the general store, buys some batteries, and watches as a small group of drunk hunters prepares to go up into the mountains. They\\'re green; one of the hunters nearly shoots his foot off as he goofs around with his hunting rifle. Logan is annoyed.<br/><br/>Logan returns to his cave and sleeps. Cries of agony ring out and he goes to investigate -- he finds the hunters\\' campsite destroyed. He sees evidence of a bear attack. He follows bear prints in the fresh mud and comes upon the same bear he\\'d seen earlier, with an arrow sticking out of its back. The grizzly is still alive and in terrible pain. The bear looks to Logan with tear-filled eyes and Logan is forced to put it out of its misery.<br/><br/>Logan plucks the arrow from its\\' hide and sniffs the tip; it\\'s coated in poison. He stalks into to the town and walks into the local bar (observed by a slight, young red-haired Japanese woman), where he finds the sole surviving hunter recounting the attack. The grizzly killed his companions; he was lucky to escape with his life. Logan, angry at the hunter, asks who shot the bear with illegal poisoned arrows -- because the poison was too low of a dose, the bear went on a rampage instead of dropping dead. The hunter denies using poison-tipped arrows, but Logan continues his accusations. Logan drives the arrow through the leader\\'s hand pinning it to a table, explaining that it was the one he pulled from the bear\\'s back; if it was not poisoned, then the hunter has nothing to worry about.<br/><br/>The hunter\\'s friends square off, ready to attack Logan, who is prepared to fight them all, when he is persuaded to stop by Yukio (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm3822462/?ref_=ttpl\">Rila Fukushima</a>), the red-haired Japanese woman carrying a samurai sword. She teases the hunters, and shows them her sword, explaining that it is hundreds of years old and is called \"Danzan\", \"The Separator\", because its purpose is to separate heads and limbs from bodies. She slices the sword through the air, nearly killing the other hunters in the process, frightening them all, and leaves. Logan leaves with her and climbs into her rental car. Logan asks who she is and why she\\'s been looking for him. She explains that she has been sent by Yashida, whose elderly body is being ravaged by cancer. Yashida wishes to speak with Logan before he dies, and thank him for saving his life 70 years earlier. Logan is reluctant to go to Tokyo, but can\\'t ignore this personal obligation.<br/><br/>Logan and Yukio fly to Tokyo and arrive at Yashida\\'s palatial residence. Logan is turned away by Yashida\\'s American oncologist (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm1300303/?ref_=ttpl\">Svetlana Khodchenkova</a>) and by Yashida\\'s grieving granddaughter Mariko (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm5148840/?ref_=ttpl\">Tao Okamoto</a>). They insist that Logan\\'s caveman-like state could prove infectious to the elderly, dying Yashida. Logan is unwillingly thrown into a bathtub and cleaned and shaved until he is less offensive and more presentable. Logan is finally allowed to speak to Yashida (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0945563/?ref_=ttpl\">Hal Yamanouchi</a>), who presents Logan with the same sword he bestowed on him 70 years earlier. Yashida has summoned Logan because he believes his cutting-edge company has the technology to present him with a unique opportunity: they can make Logan mortal, and will transfer Logan\\'s life-giving mutation into his own body. Logan is upset by Yashida\\'s request and argues that no one should want his power. As he begs Yukio to fly him home, he observes as Shingen (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0760796/?ref_=ttpl\">Hiroyuki Sanada</a>), Yashida\\'s son and Mariko\\'s father, coldly and angrily slaps his distraught daughter. Heartbroken, Mariko aims to throw herself off the nearest cliff, but is saved by Logan, angering Shingen. Yukio persuades Logan to stick around for another day or two, and finds a room for him to stay in.<br/><br/>As he sleeps, Logan dreams of Jean who climbs into bed with him and kisses him. As the dream ends, Jean becomes Yashida\\'s oncologist, Dr Green. Her snake-like tongue presses deep into Logan\\'s throat and deposits something causing a green vapor to flow from his mouth. He struggles and is knocked out. Logan awakens, having heard a commotion outside his room. He exits to find paramedics running through the estate. Seconds later, Yashida\\'s dead body is carted to the entrance. Mariko cries and Shingen hurriedly prepares the funeral.<br/><br/>Days later, Yashida\\'s funeral is held in the center of Tokyo. Logan arrives with Yukio, and shakily makes his way through the funeral procession. Shingen is especially disgusted with Logan and tells him to go home. Logan and Yukio enter the funeral and stand at the back of the crowd. The ceremony is watched by a lone archer, who quietly whispers to the spirit of Yashida that he will protect Mariko. Mariko is ushered up to the front of the funeral by a pair of traditionally-dressed priests. Logan notices that the priest\\'s arms are heavily tattooed with what are certainly Yakuza markings. Logan impulsively bursts through the crowd, angering Shingen, Mariko, and Mariko\\'s distant fiancé Noburo (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0974575/?ref_=ttpl\">Brian Tee</a>). He spots a gun-shaped bulge under one of the priests\\' robes and within seconds guns are drawn and Logan is shot in the chest. He experiences more devastating pain than usual. All the priests shed their robes, revealing Yakuza tattoos and clothing. The Yakuza grab Mariko and flee the funeral. Logan chases after them. He\\'s shot multiple times, and struggles greatly to regain his stamina; his healing ability is severely impaired. Arrows come soaring into the funeral, laying-out dozens of Yakuza members. The archer, Harada (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0498449/?ref_=ttpl\">Will Yun Lee</a>), takes out many of the Yakuza and chases after Logan and Mariko as they flee the funeral temple.<br/><br/>Logan takes Mariko deep into the city whilst being chased by the Yakuza. Mariko tries to dismiss Logan from accompanying her, but Logan follows. They board a bullet train and Logan pleads for understanding of what just happened. Mariko explains that in three days time, her grandfather\\'s will is to be read, which will name her (not her father) as the new head of the Yashida corporation. The Yakuza are desperate to kidnap her because it will mean a huge ransom. Logan disappears into the train\\'s bathroom and examines the wounds on his chest; they aren\\'t healing. He shakily exits the bathroom and is met by four Yakuza soldiers who shoot and stab him. Logan retaliates, killing two of the men and ripping a hole in the side of the train. The remaining soldiers are sucked out onto the side of the train, along with Logan, and the three battle one-another at bullet train speed. Logan defeats the Yakuza and returns to his seat in the train. He asks where Mariko is headed. Her family has a home at \"the end of the line\". Logan infers that if there were Yakuza on the train, there are sure to be some waiting for them at their destination. Mariko agrees and the two exit the train well ahead of their destination. The pair walk through the city, in search of a safe place that Mariko is familiar with, but Logan stops her, and explains that they need to find a place to stay where nobody will look for her. Logan finds a seedy-looking hotel and drags Mariko inside. It\\'s a \"love-hotel\", a pay-by-the-hour establishment. Logan thinks it\\'s perfect, because it\\'s the last place the Yakuza would look for them. They pick a \"Mars-themed\" room and hurry upstairs. While Mariko sleeps, Logan stands watch on the balcony. He dreams of Jean, and passes out. Mariko awakens and runs to his aid. Logan awakens in a veterinarian\\'s office. The son of the hotel\\'s manager is stitching up Logan\\'s wounds. He nervously backs away from Logan as he stirs, and gestures to the fresh slashes on his face and arms, all caused by Logan. Logan is stitched-up and in better form than he was the night before, but he\\'s still far from immortal.<br/><br/>Dr Green sneaks her way through a seedy back-alley. Her blonde hair draws cat-calls from middle-aged perverts who expect her to be a prostitute. She takes one by the collar and spits green acid in his face, blinding him. She continues through the alley and finds Harada, impatiently waiting for her. She\\'s two hours late and he\\'s angry. She demands to know where Mariko and Logan are. Harada\\'s men are still searching, but Mariko hasn\\'t appeared in any of her usual spots. Green, a mutant who now identifies herself as \\'Viper\\', tells him that they have less than three days to find her.<br/><br/>The following morning, Yukio calls Mariko and pleads to know where she and Logan are hiding. Mariko refuses to say, despite her closeness to Yukio, but promises that Logan is being good and is caring for her. Mariko and Logan make their way to Yashida\\'s long-forgotten home in Nagasaki. She doesn\\'t expect anyone to follow them there, because the house is old and in disrepair. They buy groceries and Mariko cooks for Logan. Mariko explains that her engagement to Noburo is an arranged marriage; for powerful and political reasons she must go through with it. She also explains about the solitary archer who she grew up with and has wanted to marry since she was 12. She asks him who Jean is, as Logan tends to repeat that name in his sleep. Logan explains the relationship he had with Jean, how he loved her and why he killed her.<br/><br/>They go for a walk, and Logan sees something familiar in the distance: the location of the prison camp, and the well in which he saved Yashida, which has long since been capped. Logan helps some locals chop wood, and begins to shed his gruff exterior, a trait that Mariko finds appealing about her guardian. The two return home and eventually make love. The following morning, Logan wakes and can\\'t find Mariko anywhere. He hears her screaming outside. The Yakuza have found them and kidnapped Mariko. Mariko is thrown into their car and Logan runs after them. One of the soldiers shoots Logan, slowing him down, but Logan manages to pull him from the vehicle. He presses the man to the ground and tortures information of Mariko\\'s whereabouts out of him.<br/><br/>Yukio arrives, having followed the Yakuza to Nagasaki, and the pair of them go after the only lead they have: Noburo, Mariko\\'s fiancé. Yukio explains to Logan that she has a gift of second sight or the ability to see death, and that she has seen Logan die with his own heart in his hand. Logan tells her than many have tried to kill him before and that he\\'s still around. They find Noburo in his apartment with a pair of western prostitutes. Logan threatens Noburo, who admits that he and Shingen had an agreement to kill Mariko, and that Shingen has her. Logan throws Noburo off a balcony and into a swimming pool. Yukio and Logan head back to Tokyo. On the way, she tells Logan that she\\'s had a vision in a dream that showed her Logan severely injured and bleeding to death. <br/><br/>Mariko arrives at the Yashida estate, where her father is waiting for her. Shingen explains that he has worked his entire life to take over the Yashida corporation once the elderly Yashida dies. When he discovered that Mariko, not himself, would be inheriting the corporation, he conspired with the Yakuza, by way of her fiancé Noburo, to have her killed before the will was read. Had Logan not intervened on the night of her grandfather\\'s death, and allowed Mariko to jump to her death, Shingen would have inherited the company immediately. Shingen, along with his small army of Yakuza, will now find a way to have Mariko killed while keeping his own hands clean.<br/><br/>Suddenly, black-suited ninjas descend upon the compound and secretly dispatch the Yakuza. The ninjas are led by Harada and Viper. Shingen is cornered by the ninjas and Viper explains that there are greater forces at work than the Yakuza and him. She spits in his face, severely disfiguring it, and tosses him into a pool. Viper, Harada, and his men take Mariko and disappear.<br/><br/>Logan and Yukio arrive and find evidence of the massacre. They make their way into Yashida\\'s private room, filled with high tech medical equipment and x-ray scanners. Logan climbs into Yashida\\'s MRI machine and guides the x-ray over his body and discovers, shockingly, a metallic parasite attached to his heart, implanted by Viper days earlier. The device has impaired his healing ability. Logan, against Yukio\\'s pleas, cuts open his chest with one of his claws and reaches for his heart. Shingen, who had survived Viper\\'s acidic attack, appears dressed in traditional samurai armor. He seeks to kill Logan, and swings his sword at him. Yukio saves Logan, and battles Shingen while Logan reaches further into his chest. Ultimately Logan manages to grab, extract and destroy the robotic parasite, but loses consciousness. He lays on Yashida\\'s bed, with a giant open wound on his abdomen. Shingen bests Yukio, knocking her sword away from her, and aims to cut her in two when Logan\\'s clawed hand suddenly appears, blocking the blow; Logan has healed and gets to his feet and goes after Shingen. Shingen skewers Logan\\'s body with multiple swords, but is unable to kill him. Logan gets within arm\\'s reach of Shingen, but decides to let him live, arguing that he should live knowing that he tried to kill his own daughter. As he walks away Shingen runs after him, running his sword through him. Logan stabs Shingen through the throat, killing him instantly. Logan returns to Yashida\\'s room where Yukio has found Mariko\\'s whereabouts -- a Yashida facility built in the village where he grew up. She also discovers strange robotic designs strewn about the room. Logan takes a Yakuza motorcycle parked out front and heads to the Yashida facility.<br/><br/>The facility is high in the mountains. Logan drives into the village and watches as dozens of locals citizens flee to their homes. Seconds later Harada appears, and tells Logan to leave. Logan refuses, so Harada slashes at him. Harada watches in disbelief as Logan\\'s fresh wound heals. Harada orders his ninja-clad men to kill Logan. All at once, arrows attached to ropes come streaming in from the adjacent rooftops, and within seconds Logan is impaled dozens of times. Harada, having dipped the heads of his arrows into Viper\\'s venom, launches them at Logan, weakening him considerably. Logan finally passes out.<br/><br/>Logan awakens inside the facility, strapped into a stock, forcing his hands forward and away from his body, unable to move. Viper appears, and congratulates Logan on removing her parasite. Logan hears Mariko screaming his name, and sees a massive, metallic mechanical samurai sitting to his left. To his shock, the mech gets to its feet and walks over to Logan. Viper explains that Yashida had been stockpiling adamantium in recent years, having been obsessed with Wolverine\\'s adamantium skeleton. He built this suit of armor out of the material, and with it, Wolverine can be killed. Viper angers Logan and goads him into extending his claws. As soon as he does so, constraints are clasped onto his hands, preventing him from retracting the claws. Wolverine watches in horror as the giant, mechanical, adamantium samurai approaches him and draws an 8-foot long flaming sword. It positions itself to cut off his claws. Mariko struggles with Harada and stabs him. She runs to Logan\\'s side and distracts the samurai, who slashes Logan\\'s restraints open, allowing him to escape. Yukio, who had followed Logan, arrives at the back door of the facility and sneaks inside. She battles Viper while Logan deflects blows from the much larger and stronger Samurai. The Samurai cuts the claws off of one of Wolverine\\'s hands, revealing bone underneath the adamantium. Logan battles the Samurai one-handed, wrestles its massive sword away from it and slashes the Samurai\\'s helmet off. The out-of-control mechanical samurai slashes open the side of the facility, and pushes Logan out through the hole. Logan dangles hundreds of feet over the ground and hastily climbs back into the facility.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Yuriko is battling Viper and losing. Harada, seeing that his actions have been dishonorable, makes a last effort at redemption, killing Viper and himself.<br/><br/>Suddenly the samurai\\'s sword comes swooping over Logan\\'s head, cutting his other hand\\'s claws clean off, and the pilot of the mechanical samurai is revealed to be Yashida, the old man thought dead. Yashida explains that his life\\'s goal since meeting Logan was to prolong his own life, at whatever cost. When Logan refused to go through with the procedure at his estate, he faked his own death with the assistance of Viper and kidnapped Mariko, knowing that it would lead Logan to him. Yashida (in the samurai suit) grabs Logan\\'s wrists and six drills come out of the suit\\'s forearms. The needles drill into Logan\\'s exposed bone-claws, straight into the marrow. Within seconds, Logan begins to grow old and Yashida, by way of the interconnected suit, becomes young again. Yashida laughs as he siphons the life from Logan. Mariko has freed herself from Harada and sees and hears her Grandfather\\'s plan. Suddenly one of Logan\\'s separated claws comes flying through the air and lands in Yashida\\'s skull. Mariko confronts her grandfather and stabs him in the head again. Logan is freed from the suit\\'s drills, his life returns to his eyes, and he instantly grows back his bone claws. Logan stabs Yashida, and pushes Yashida, and the suit, out of the facility. It crashes on the rocks below.<br/><br/>Yukio, who had survived her encounter with the Viper, joins Logan on an airport runway. The biggest news of the day is that Mariko Yashida has inherited her grandfather\\'s corporation. Mariko kisses Logan on the runway and hints that he should come back to see her soon, but the two agree that they have separate paths to follow. Logan boards the plane and Yukio follows. She gleefully tells Logan to consider her his bodyguard and asks Logan where he would like to go. Logan gives her an indefinite response, but he\\'s happy that she\\'s with him.<br/><br/>CREDITS SPOILER:<br/><br/>Two years later, Logan (minus Yukio) is walking into an Airport Security checkpoint and asks for the pat down. An overhead TV shows a commercial for \\'Trask Industries\\', and Logan pays little attention to it. Suddenly the coins, watches, and pens in the X-ray machine begin to float. Logan, aware of this magnetic anomaly, immediately ejects his bone claws and spins around to see Magneto (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0005212/?ref_=ttpl\">Ian McKellen</a>) behind him. Magneto freezes Logan in place, and urges Logan to lower his defenses. He tells Logan that his mission is a peaceful one, and that he hasn\\'t come alone. Logan turns away from Magneto and watches as everybody surrounding them freezes in place. A wheelchair silently weaves through the sea of frozen bodies, and in its\\' seat is Charles Xavier (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0001772/?ref_=ttpl\">Patrick Stewart</a>). Logan is speechless at seeing Xavier alive. Magneto and Xavier explain they need Logan to save all of mutant-kind.</div></div>'}\n",

His work focuses on using nanomeds and gamma radiation to cure cancer and other diseases. Unfortunately, all of their experiments end in the test animals exploding. He works with Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly); they were recently romantically involved but have broken up because Bruce was too withdrawn emotionally. Although neither of them know it, their fathers worked together on an Army base in New Mexico, in the late 1960s. David Banner (Paul Kersey) was a driven research scientist intent on unlocking the secrets of regeneration of tissue so that humans could regrow lost limbs. Sgt. Ross (Todd Tesen) shut down Brian\\'s experiments when he learned he had been experimenting on himself. David was aware of the risks and already feared that he had passed on some genetic mutation to young Bruce. Bruce was a quiet, troubled child who was comfortable only in the presence of his mother, Edith (Cara Buono). After being fired, David sabotaged his equipment which resulted in an explosion on base. He then went home, fought with Edith and tried to kill young Bruce. Instead he accidentally killed Edith. David was arrested and incarcerated in a mental hospital. Bruce was placed with foster parents. He has repressed his memories of his parents, and because Bruce works under his foster parents\\' name (Krensler), Betty\\'s father doesn\\'t recognize him. Ironically, Ross oversees the research Betty and Bruce perform.<br/><br/>Glenn Talbot (Josh Lucas) used to work for the same lab as Betty and Bruce but has since moved on to a private corporation, Atheon. He returns to the lab, flirts with Betty and offers her and Bruce an unlimited budget if they will bring their research to his corporation. They both refuse but Bruce\\'s anger begins to rise anyway. Later that day, an experiment goes horribly awry. Bruce is exposed to massive doses of nanomeds and gamma radiation. Unlike the other test subjects, however, he doesn\\'t die. In the hospital he is visited by a strange man who had earlier begun to work at the lab as a janitor. Although Bruce doesn\\'t recognize him, it is his father (Nick Nolte). His father suggests that Bruce has secret reserves of power hidden within him, then disappears. After being released from the hospital, Bruce returns to work. He hears a phone message from Betty in which she discusses a meeting she had with now-General Ross (Sam Elliot) about Talbot\\'s offer. Bruce\\'s rage spirals out of control and he transforms into the Hulk, a superhumanly powerful, green-skinned creature. He destroys the lab and throws the gamma radiation generator into the parking lot. When he sees his father observing his rampage, the Hulk leaps away in confusion.<br/><br/>Because Bruce was the last person in the lab, he is under suspicion for destroying it and is placed under lockdown by Ross. Betty goes to see David. He tells her as well about Bruce\\'s power before curtly showing her the door. Upset, Betty drives to her cabin in the mountains. David has created a trio of superpowered gamma dogs using equipment purloined from the labs. Using a scarf she left behind, he gives the dogs Betty\\'s scent and sends them to kill her. He then calls Bruce to tell him he has done so, to coax the Hulk out of him. Just then Talbot arrives to confront Bruce. Ross has ordered Talbot to leave Betty and Bruce alone, enraging Talbot. He tries to beat Bruce but manages only to anger him enough to cause another transformation into the Hulk. Hulk beats Talbot badly then escapes the Army guards to find and protect Betty. At the mountain cabin, he fights and kills the gamma dogs. Exhausted, he transforms back into Bruce before Betty\\'s eyes. The next morning, the Army arrives and sedates Bruce. Betty, unsure of what to do, had called her father during the night.<br/><br/>By now Ross knows who Bruce is. He has Bruce and Betty taken back to the New Mexico base where David and he had worked earlier. Betty and Bruce walk the grounds in an attempt to understand how Bruce became who he is. Before any real breakthrough can be made, Ross\\' superiors place Bruce in Talbot\\'s care. Talbot has assured them he can find out what causes Bruce to become the Hulk, and harness that power for the military. Betty leaves the base. Talbot taunts Bruce then knocks him out. Bruce is placed in an isolation tank so Talbot can perform tests on him. As Talbot probes, however, he unleashes the Hulk. The Hulk breaks free of the tank and begins to wreak havoc on the Army base. In the process, Talbot is killed. Ross decides to free Hulk from the base and then destroy him outside. The Hulk destroys four Army heavy tanks and leaps off into the desert to hide. Ross and his forces find him and he leads the Army on a chase throughout the Southwestern United States, battling briefly with a small unit of Comanche choppers. Firing on a series of rock towers to bury him, the Hulk escapes and heads in the direction of San Francisco. There he proceeds to wreak havoc in the city until Betty arrives and calms him down. He transforms back into Bruce.<br/><br/>David uses the restored gamma radiation generator and nanomeds to make himself into a superhuman being. He is now able to adopt the physical properties of anything he comes in contact with. He contacts Betty and agrees to turn himself in to Gen. Ross if he will be allowed to see Bruce. Ross agrees. Father and son meet in an abandoned warehouse. David tries to persuade Bruce to accept his power and join him but Bruce refuses. David taps into a powerline and becomes living electricity. Bruce transforms into the Hulk and the two men battle. They eventually wind up at a secluded lake. David decides to absorb all of Bruce\\'s power for himself. However Bruce\\'s power is so immense, David cannot contain it all and explodes. As that happens, the Army drops a bomb on the site, destroying it.<br/><br/>Bruce\\'s body is never found. Ross keeps in touch with Betty and hopes that if Bruce were ever to contact her, she would tell him. But he knows she wouldn\\'t. In a South American rain forest, an American doctor provides inoculation shots to the needy. Mercenaries attack his camp to confiscate the supplies. As his eyes begin to glow green, Bruce warns them not to make him angry.</div></div>'}\n",

In the first, a group of research scientists from a variety of backgrounds are investigating the strange appearance of items in remote locations, primarily desert regions. In continuing their investigation, one of the lead scientists, a Frenchman named Claude Lacombe, incorporates the Kodály method of music education as a means of communication in their work. The response, in turn, at first baffles the researchers, until American cartographer David Laughlin deciphers the meaning of the response. In the second, electric company lineman and family man Roy Neary and single mother Jillian Guiler are among some individuals in Muncie, Indiana who experience some paranormal activity before some flashes of bright lights in the sky, which they believe to be a UFO. Roy becomes obsessed with what he saw, unlike some others, especially in some form of authority, who refuse to acknowledge their belief that it was a UFO in not wanting to appear crazy. That obsession both for Roy and Jillian is ratcheted up a notch when they begin to have a vision of a mound with vertical striations on its side as a key to what is going on. While the obsession negatively affects Roy\\'s life as he knows it in its entirety, Jillian knows she has to find the answer as to its meaning, especially as it relates to her only child, three year old Barry Guiler, who may be more attuned to what is happening than the adult figures around him. These two stories have the potential to intersect if Roy and Jillian can discover where they\\'ve seen that mound before, and if they can overcome what they believe to be the lies perpetrated by those in authority in covering up what is going on.<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=Huggo&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_2\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Huggo</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">Tormented by strange, unexplained visions after what seemed like a close encounter of the first kind, Indiana family man Roy Neary struggles to understand.

Now, the U.S. government is trying to run the show, and French scientist Claude Lacombe hopes to communicate with the extraterrestrial visitors. But Roy must know. Is the image haunting his mind real?

Though David has been hired as Mr Lacombe\\'s interpreter, he explains that he is actually a cartographer (a mapmaker). The two men along with a crew soon find a strange sight: a circular ring of airplanes in brand-new condition, with fuel still in the tank. The planes are identified as belonging to \\'Flight 19,\\' a group of US Naval planes that were reported missing off the coast of Florida in 1945. The men soon after find a local who reported the planes. David and Claude find the man has red sunburned marks on the side of his face. Through an interpreter, the man claims the sun came out that evening, and talked to him.<br/><br/>In an air traffic control tower in the US, some of the air traffic controllers receive reports of unidentified aircraft flying dangerously an commercial flight. When the tower requests that the pilots wish to report a \\'UFO (unidentified flying object),\\' both planes decline, primarily because they\\'re so confounded, they feel they wouldn\\'t know what to report.<br/><br/>In Muncie, Indiana, a strange power outage blackens the area. This incident affects two different families of people. The first is Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon). When she wakes in the middle of the night and finds her son Barry (Cary Guffey) missing, she wanders off into the countryside to find him.<br/><br/>The second person is Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss). Roy gets a call from the power company he works for, and goes out to answer a service call. However, stopping at a railroad crossing, a number of metal objects in the vicinity (including Roy\\'s truck) begin to act strangely. A strange craft appears overhead, and flashes bright lights at Roy before flying off. Once the craft has disappeared, Roy races off, almost hitting Barry on a hillside road.<br/><br/>As Jillian appears, several strangely-lit craft fly by, along with a bright red light at the tail end. Entranced by the strange objects, Roy gets back in his truck and gives chase, along with several local police cars, all of them passing through a toll booth at the border of Ohio. The strange objects fly off over the edge of a cliff, and as Roy and the officers watch, ascend into some thundering storm clouds overhead, as the darkened city underneath them regains power.<br/><br/>Roy returns to his family eager to tell of what he saw, but his wife Ronnie (Teri Garr) refuses to acknowledge her husband\\'s flights of fancy. Even though Roy has red sunburns from being flashed by the craft he saw, she still doesn\\'t \\'believe.\\'<br/><br/>Some time afterward, Roy meets up with Jillian and Barry, and Jillian relates how there seems to be a melody and an image of a mountain she cannot get out of her mind. Roy soon finds himself obsessing over the same mountain image, carving it in mashed potatoes as well as sculpting it out of putty or shaving cream.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Bob and Claude have gone around the world and observed other strange phenomenon: A group of people in India have been chanting a strange 5-note sequence that they claim came from the sky. A missing ship named the Coat Appoxi has appeared in another desert region. Information gleaned from the musical notation sequence and a message indicates that there appears to be plans for extraterrestrial life to descend to Earth. The military and NASA coordinate a plan to create a false scare in the landing region, northwestern Wyoming, that a toxic spill will make the area dangerous.<br/><br/>Back in Muncie, Jillian is shocked one evening when the same lights as before descend towards her home, and soon after abduct her son Barry. Still in a state of shock, Jillian takes her story to the news outlets.<br/><br/>Shortly thereafter, a person from the US Government sits down for a town hall chat with several locals in attendance (including Roy and his family), denying that there are UFO\\'s, or that the government is covering up any such incidents.<br/><br/>Roy is slowly losing his mind over the strange images in his head. One morning he begins to throw dirt, plants, bricks and chicken fencing into the kitchen window. His behavior finally drives Ronnie to take their kids and leave. After they have left, Roy constructs an enormous miniature of a flat-topped mountain in his family\\'s living room. After an argument with his wife on the phone, he sees a news report on the television, showing Devil\\'s Tower...the same structure he\\'s been obsessed with.<br/><br/>Roy heads off towards Devil\\'s Tower, only to encounter everyone leaving in the wake of a (fake) chemical spill warning. Roy also finds Jillian there, and the two attempt to get to Devil\\'s Tower, but are captured by some military men.<br/><br/>Roy and Jillian are separated, with Roy brought before Bob and Claude. The two listen to Roy\\'s story...a story that sounds similar to several other people who have been drawn to the mountainous structure nearby. The two make an impassioned plea to the Military Director at the base, but he refuses to believe their \\'theory\\' that these people were \\'invited,\\' and attempts to fly the civilians out.<br/><br/>Jillian and Roy manage to escape with another man named Larry, making it to the other side of the mountain before night settles in. The Army sprays the area around the mountain with a sedative dust, putting Larry to sleep. Roy and Jillian evade the choppers, finding an enormous landing strip constructed on the east side of the mountain. The two secretly make their way down as several smaller lit ships appear, before a giant \\'mother ship\\' hovers down. The scientists in the compound attempt to communicate with the aliens, first with the smaller ships and then with a much larger \"mother ship\" which dwarfs the mountain itself. After a few moments of musical exchange, the bottom of the ship opens and dozens of people abducted by the aliens are returned, seemingly unharmed and having not aged a day. Among them his Jillian\\'s son. A few minutes later, the bottom of the ship opens again and the aliens reveal themselves to the scientists: they are humanoid in appearance, but very small, no larger than 3 feet, with large eyes. <br/><br/>When Claude sees that Roy has witnessed the exchange, he asks if Roy would be willing to join the dozen people that have been selected to leave with the aliens. Roy willingly accepts. When they line up to enter the ship, one of the aliens walks down the line of volunteers and chooses Roy. (In a deleted scene, Roy enters the ship and sees a cavernous room with 1000s of the aliens and vegetation.) <br/><br/>In a final exchange, one of the aliens gives the hand salute interpretation of the 5 note musical tone to Claude himself, who smiles. <br/><br/>After Roy and several others board the ship, it takes off for distant space.<br/><br/><ul><li>Done by KrystelClaire:</li></ul><br/><br/>Strange events are happening all over the world: a UFO is said to have appeared in the Mojave desert in New Mexico, a long-ago lost ship appears in the middle of the Ghobi desert, many Indian people start to chant a tune they have heard coming from \"above\", and some airplanes have sights of flying saucers. A team of people are investigating all these phenomena, specially Claude Lacombe (renown French director François Truffaut) and his interpreter Jean Claude (Philip Dodds)<br/><br/>In the USA, Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) is trying to find his way at night. He\\'s close to home, but is looking for the place he has to go to in a map. He is an electric company technician who has to solve a problem with an electrical blackout. While waiting at a railroad crossing, everything seems to go crazy around him -- his flashlight won\\'t work, the radio in his truck goes haywire, and some mailboxes along the road open themselves. Suddenly, a bright light lands on the truck. Looking out of the window, he is flashed several times by what seems to be a UFO. Roy then attempts to drive after the three small flying saucers and a small red light.<br/><br/>Mainwhile, Barry Guiler (Cary Guffey), a little boy of around 6, wakes up because all his toys start playing themselves and making noise in the middle of the night. He goes out of home on his own. He lives in a cheap home nearby a forest. Dressed in his pyjamas, he goes out. A toy police car wakes up his mother Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) as well. From her window, she calls out for him, but Barry enters the wood anyway, laughing alone. Jillian runs after him. When she catches up with him, Barry is standing up in the middle of a curvy town road. He seems stunned, dazed. Jillian arrives just in time to save him from being run over by Roy.<br/><br/>The UFOs disappear among cloudy and stormy weather. Many people have seen them, and they wait all through the night in the same curve of the same road for the UFOs to appear again, hoping for a friendly sign. Roy, Barry and Jillian are among those people.<br/><br/>During daylight, they all try to go on with their lives. However, it seems that they can\\'t cope. Barry repeats a lullaby over and over again. Jillian tries to draw a mountain she has never seen, and Roy seems to have gone crazy. He makes all kinds of strange attemps to create a sculpture of the same mountain than Jillian. First with shaving foam, secondly with mashed potatoes. The three children of the couple, Brad, Sylvia and Toby (Shawn Bishop, Adrienne Campbell and Justin Dreyfuss), become silent and frightened as well, after a terrible row with plenty of shouting on everybody\\'s part. As a higher level of Roy\\'s brand-new eccentric behaviour, he starts pulling out some small trees from his home garden in a frenzy, and also he steals his neighbour\\'s duck pond metal rail in plain daylight. His wife Ronnie (Teri Garr) is getting more and more frightened because of her husband\\'s hectic behaviour. She cannot take it anymore and leaves him. She takes her children with her, while neighbours stop doing their everyday chores to look in amazement at the final row of the couple.<br/><br/>Now Roy can create his mountain sculpture without being disturbed. He makes it so huge that it occupies all the kitchen. While he is talking on the phone, he finally realises what he is so obsessed about. The famous anchorman Howard K. Smith (himself) is announcing on TV that Devil\\'s Peak is being evacuated, because there is a deadly gas leaked in the atmosphere. They show some images of the place, so Roy decides to make the journey there immediately.<br/><br/>At the same time, Barry has disappeared. He had been kidnapped by the supposed energy of a UFO. Jillian had tried to prevent it, closing all doors, windows, and even the chimney place, but it is useles. Barry feels attracted by the lights and he goes into them through the dog trap in the main door. Newspapers will laugh about Jillian\\'s evidence before the police, claiming that she alleges that \"some clouds kidnapped my son\", and treat her like a demented person.<br/><br/>The following day, Roy is driving in the opposite direction. He arrives at the nearest train station to the mountain, where hundreds of people are boarding a train in panic, climbing into the wagons through the windows and even getting on top of some coaches. The military police are watching all the operation. There, Roy finds Jillian, who wants to go to the same place than him. They get out of the station quietly helped by the chaos. Jillian is carrying two pigeons in a small cage, in the hope that, if there is any poisonous substances in the air, the birds will die before she does so. They drive together across fields and empty roads with many cows and horses dead along the way. They get close to their destination, but they are stopped by the miliatry police and the two French investigators dressed in white, astronaut-like outfits and gas masks. One of them forces Roy and Jillian to get into a white van, while taking the cage with the two birds, now completely dead. Jillian, Roy and another man jump off from the helicopter which was going to take them out of the area. They had taken off their masks, proving that there is no real danger in breathing the alledgedly deadly air. The three runaways make it to the mountain, being followed by armed soldiers and several helicopters. The third man gets gassed out and passes out so the two main characters are the only ones who make it to the other side of the mountain.<br/><br/>There, Jillian and Roy find a kind of runway lane surrounded by scientifical devices and cameras by all sides except one. There are people all over the place, some of them armed with heavy weaponry, and the two Frenchmen are also there. Jillian and Roy look at the sudden weather changes hidden behind some mountain rocks. The UFO\\'s appear, altogether with the smaller red light. They fly so close to them that they could have almost touched them.<br/><br/>The UFO\\'s and the official people maintain a kind of dialogue: they play the tune which Barry and the Indian people sang. They use a kind of huge keyboard and a screen with light and colours. Everything is successful. Roy goes down the mountain after having kissed Jillian but she prefers to stay hidden behind a rock. He thinks he is going to be captured by an army officer, but the man is running away, hiding himself on the portable toilet facility, a scene which will be repeated later on Spielberg\\'s Jurassik Park film. The UFOs go away. The French people see Roy, but they let him be.<br/><br/>The scientists are going to start to analyse all the materials they have recorded. All of a sudden, the hugest UFO of them all appear, and they all go back to their positions. Again, there is the tuned music conversation, accompained by coloured lights. The music moves faster and faster until it dies out. Everybody is watching, breathless.<br/><br/>The UFO is opened. Through the below part of the device, several people (and a dog) who had previously disappeared, walk out of the UFO. They are all healthy and calm. One of the last ones is Barry. Jillian leaves her hiding place and goes running to him, hugging and kissing her son while crying tender tears. Barry does not look traumatized or hurt in any way.<br/><br/>The UFO door opens again. First, a long-legged and long-armed creature appears. The next instant, some twenty grey-skinned aliens appear and get out of the UFO. They have got no hair, they are naked, and they are as tall as a child. One of the aliens repeats the hand movements which represent the music tune.<br/><br/>Some volunteers, including Roy, decide to go into the UFO with the aliens. No aliens stay on Earth. The spacecraft and their occupants fly away from planet Earth into the million-starred celestial copola.<br/><br/>--originally written by KrystelClaire</div></div>'}\n",

Where police officer John Anderton (who lost his son to a murder 6 years previous) has stopped numerous murders in his career. One day, he found out that he is the next person to commit a murder.

Now, on the run from the law for a homicide he is yet to commit in less than thirty-six hours, Detective Anderton has to use every trick in the book to prove his innocence, and clear his name. But, in Burgess\\' state-of-the-art system, there is no such thing as a mistake.

Anderton is addicted in drugs since her lost his son in a swimming pool and separated from his wife Lara Lara Clarke and was recruited by Burgess to run the department. The Precogs are mutants led by Agatha and capable to foresee crimes in the near future. The agent from the Department of Justice Danny Witwer comes to PreCrime to audit the system and out of the blue, the PreCogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder. He flees and becomes a fugitive while he tries to prove that he is innocent.

In an effort to contain the violence, the Metropolitan Police Department of Washington DC have founded a new task force called PreCrime, allowing a specially-assigned unit to proactively stop murders before they can even be committed. Their means of doing so is through \"PreCogs\" (short for \"pre-cognitives\"), three mentally-altered humans who are capable of seeing the future. When the PreCogs sense that a murder is going to be committed, an automated system processes two painted wooden balls: one with the name of the perpetrator(s) engraved into it, and one with the name of the victim(s) engraved into it (the shape and grain of each ball is unique, rendering the system fully tamper-proof). The color of the ball is indicative of what kind of murder is going to happen: a brown ball indicates a premeditated murder, which the PreCogs can predict up to four days before it is committed. A red ball indicates a crime of passion, which, due to the lack of premeditation, cannot be seen until often no less than an hour before it will be committed.<br/><br/>The only three things that the PreCogs can predict are the victim or victims, the perpetrator, the exact date and time of the crime, and the exact sequence of events that lead up to the crime. As they cannot pinpoint the location of the crime, the PreCrime task force led by John Anderton (Tom Cruise), must perform a meticulous process called \"scrubbing\", where they process the images produced from the PreCogs\\' visions in order to locate telltale clues and thus narrow down the location. Once they are certain of the location, the team flies off in a special aircraft to thwart the crime. They then secure the culprit by \"haloing\" them (a device placed around his head that renders them fully incapacitated).<br/><br/>The movie opens with Anderton\\'s team catching an early morning Red Ball case. The perpetrator is going to be a male in his 40s named Howard Marks, who in exactly 24 minutes is going to catch his wife Sarah in bed with another man named Donald Dubin. Upon finding them together, Howard will stab them both to death with a pair of scissors.<br/><br/>Anderton scrubs through the images, while also having to deal with the arrival of Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), a Justice Department official who\\'s been sent to audit the PreCrime system before a Congressional vote on whether or not to take the system nationwide. One of Anderton\\'s colleagues named Fletcher, explains to Witwer the basic workings of the system as Anderton continues analyzing the vision. John soon narrows down the location, and joins a number of PreCrime officers going to the location, leaving Witwer back at PreCrime headquarters.<br/><br/>With mere seconds to go, Anderton and his colleagues find the residence, and stop Howard before the PreCog\\'s vision can come to pass. Howard is identified by iris scan, and is promptly arrested and \"haloed\", while his wife and her lover are immediately given counseling by a trauma response unit.<br/><br/>After the suspect has been apprehended, the murder reappears on the displays back at headquarters. Witwer sees these and questions one of the technicians about this, and is informed that sometimes after a crime that has been stopped, the PreCogs have these \"echo\" images pass through their minds, before they are deleted from the system.<br/><br/>That evening, Anderton reminisces over home movies of his ex-wife Lara (Kathryn Morris) and the couple\\'s missing six-year-old son, who disappeared several years before at a public swimming pool. Anderton is also shown to have an addiction to an illegal inhaled hallucinogen called Neuroin (New Heroin).<br/><br/>The next morning, Witwer\\'s official tour of the PreCrime headquarters begins. Throughout the tour, Witwer points out there are potential questions about the ethics of the PreCogs. Anderton and his colleagues explain that the system is designed in a way to be practically foolproof, due to the nature of premeditation and the fact that the PreCogs see what the killer will do, not what they intend to do (this is why they don\\'t get false alarms caused by people who contemplate murdering someone but will never actually go through with it).<br/><br/>At Witwer\\'s insistence, Anderton takes him into the chamber in which the PreCogs are kept semiconscious in a pool of fluid similar to amniotic fluid and are wired to the PreCrime computer system. Though he is somewhat impressed by what he has seen, and even with the absence of murders in D.C. since the program started, Witwer is still convinced that the program is not flawless.<br/><br/>After Witwer has gone, the PreCog Agatha (Samantha Morton) snaps fully awake, and images of a woman being murdered play across the chambers video screens.<br/><br/>Curious as to these images, Anderton goes down to Containment, where numerous other haloed Precrime assailants are kept. With the aid of a supervisor named Gideon (Tim Blake Nelson), Anderton finds the assailant who was in Agatha\\'s Previs, though he is classified as a John Doe, due to him having swapped out his eyes for someone else\\'s, to fool the identification sensors.<br/><br/>Gideon attempts to pull up more information on the case, but finds that of the three precogs, Agatha\\'s Previs is missing. As well, information on where the supposed victim named Ann Lively is, is also missing. The only information that the computer has on her, is that she was a single mother, who was also a Neuroin addict, but records indicate she went to a rehabilitation clinic to treat her habit.<br/><br/>Anderton reports his findings to Precrime Director Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow), who suggests that he let the matter drop. Turning his attention towards the thought that when Precrime goes nationwide, they need to find a way to protect it from larger interests. Anderton assures his mentor that he won\\'t let that happen.<br/><br/>Upon returning to his office, Anderton is alerted to a premeditated murder that is to take place in 36 hours. The victim has already been identified as Leo Crow, but the perpetrator\\'s identity is still a mystery. As he begins to review the information, Anderton is shaken when he soon finds out that he is the perpetrator! Anderton attempts to get out of the building before this revelation reaches his colleagues, but encounters Witwer in the elevator, leading John to think that Witwer is setting him up. However, an alarm in the building sounds, and Anderton rushes from the elevator, and out of the building.<br/><br/>It isn\\'t long before PreCrime officers find John. He manages to escape from them, but then is found by Witwer and some officers. The chase leads the group into an automated auto assembly plant, where Anderton survives, and escapes in a newly-built car.<br/><br/>He makes his way to the residence of Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith), whose research laid the groundwork for the Precrime program, upon finding out that some children of Neuroin addicts, soon developed the ability to see future murders. Quite eccentric but still coherent, Hineman explains that the three precogs do not always agree on their visions of the future; when this happens, the one that deviates the most from the others is typically ignored. In order to establish his innocence, Anderton must determine if he has a \"minority report\" that will clear his name. Anderton is puzzled as to which of the precogs would generate a minority report, and Hineman tells him its the \"most talented\" of the three: Agatha.<br/><br/>Since everyone is subjected to iris scans wherever they go, Anderton undergoes an eye transplant at the hands of a shady doctor. The doctor is actually one of John\\'s past cases, whom he busted for performing questionable surgery, however, the doctor performs the procedure anyway, leaving John alone to recover.<br/><br/>While recovering after the surgery, he dreams about the day his son was abducted from a swimming pool, and awakens to find the Precrime team searching the building for him. Small robotic eye scanners known as \"spiders\" are sent into the rooms; one of them finds Anderton and scans his iris, but the surgery has succeeded and he is not recognized. Returning to the Precrime offices in disguise, Anderton removes Agatha from the precogs chamber, disrupting the trio\\'s hive mind that makes the system work.<br/><br/>He takes her to a hacker friend of his, who successfully extracts her vision of Crow\\'s murder for Anderton to see. However, the vision does not deviate from what he saw previously, and Anderton realizes that he doesn\\'t have a minority report.<br/><br/>Suddenly, Agatha begins to have a seizure, and the image of Ann Lively being drowned is seen again. As Anderton watches the vision, his friend alerts him to Precrime officers in their vicinity. Agatha and Anderton narrowly escape Anderton\\'s team, by making use of strategic information provided by Agatha, who is able to predict the immediate future.<br/><br/>Anderton tracks down Crow\\'s address and gains entry to his apartment. Crow is not present, but he finds a pile of photographs of children, including his missing son. Anderton realizes that there is no minority report in his case and he is now going to kill Crow, whom he now blames for the kidnapping. When Crow enters, Anderton assaults him to extract a confession as Agatha pleads with Anderton not to commit this murder. Anderton is blind to her pleas and is intending to kill Crow, until the timer on his watch goes off... the time when the murder is supposed to take place. Anderton relents, and begins to read Crow his Miranda rights. Crow reveals that the photographs are doctored and were given to him to leave in the apartment in order to set up this very confrontation. His family has been promised a cash payoff only if Anderton kills him; to force this outcome, Crow grabs Anderton\\'s gun hand, aims the weapon at himself, and pulls the trigger.<br/><br/>After Anderton and Agatha flee, Witwer and the Precrime team arrive to investigate the crime scene. Witwer is skeptical about the \"orgy of evidence\" that was left behind and later discusses his misgiving with Burgess, bringing up the Lively case as well. He now has all three precogs records of that murder, but slight differences between them lead him to deduce what really happened that day.<br/><br/>Witwer shows Burgess the previsions from containment, but then reveals Agatha\\'s which was not on file. Agatha\\'s vision shows a very big difference, leading Witwer to postulate that the crime against Anne Lively took place at two different times. When Burgess questions Witwer, the young man posits his theory: Ann Lively\\'s potential killer was arrested based on the matching visions of Arthur and Dashiell, but after Precrime had taken the man away, a second person (dressed to look identical the potential killer), arrived and killed her in exactly the same manner. The similarity of the incidents would simply lead the precog techs to assume the act Agatha witnessed was an \\'echo\\' vision, and therefore, disregard it. Witwer suggests that only a member of Precrime could have the skill to manipulate the system in this way, whereupon Burgess, revealing himself as the true architect of John\\'s framing, shoots and kills Witwer, knowing that the other precogs are unable to foresee this murder with Agatha gone. Shortly after the murder, Lara calls Burgess to tell him that John and Agatha are staying with her.<br/><br/>As she relaxes in the calm surroundings of Lara\\'s home, Agatha shares with John and Lara a vision of what might have been had their son lived. During this time, John has been thinking about Anne Lively, and deduces that she is Agatha\\'s mother. However, PreCrime soon swarms the house, and John is halo\\'ed and Agatha is returned to the PreCogs chamber.<br/><br/>Burgess later meets with Lara to comfort her, before he is to attend a ceremony in anticipation of the nationwide PreCrime roll-out. During this time, Lara brings up Ann Lively, which Burgess claims he has no knowledge of. However, he claims he\\'ll go to the containment chamber and inquire to Gideon if anyone drowned a woman by that name. His mentioning of the cause of death (which she didn\\'t reveal to Burgess), then makes Lara suspicious.<br/><br/>Realizing Burgess is lying, Lara rushes back to precog headquarters and forces Gideon to release Anderton. Once he\\'s out, Anderton calls Burgess to reveal he\\'s figured out his whole murderous modus operandi.<br/><br/>Of the three PreCogs, Agatha was the strongest, and enabled much of the program to continue. However, her mother Ann Lively, got over her Neuroin addiction, and wanted her daughter back. Knowing this would sideline the program, Lamarr arranged for the John Doe Anderton saw in containment, to attempt the murder. Once PreCrime had apprehended the \\'suspect,\\' Burgess appeared to Ann, and donning a disguise similar to the suspect\\'s, killed Ann in the way the PreCogs saw. But, given that PreCrime had apprehended a suspect, it was assumed Agatha\\'s vision of her mother\\'s death was little more than an \\'echo.\\' Thus, the vision was deleted, and Ann Lively just became another \\'missing person.\\'<br/><br/>As Lamarr and John continue to talk, a new red ball murder is detected by the precogs, with Anderton as victim and Burgess as perpetrator. Realizing that Anderton must be somewhere nearby, Burgess takes an antique revolver given to him as a gift and searches for him. When the two men come face to face, Anderton points out that Lamarr is in a Catch-22: if Burgess kills him, he will prove that Precrime works, but will go to prison for life. If he doesn\\'t shoot, the Precrime system is proven to be unreliable. Burgess resolves the dilemma with a third option: killing himself.<br/><br/>With the Precrime program having been found to be subject to manipulation and thus flawed, it is quickly abandoned. All criminals imprisoned under it are granted immediate pardons and are released from prison, though local police departments keep watch on many of them for years. Anderton reconciles with Lara, now pregnant with their second child, and the precogs are moved to an unnamed remote location where they can live in peace.</div></div>'}\n",

A mysterious blue entity leaves the planet prior to its destruction, and is next seen flying through the atmosphere over Earth. At the same time, a number of strange circumstances unfold (the China Sea freezes over and the Sphinx is covered with snow).<br/><br/>A news reporter states that the FAA was forced to ground all flights as a result of these events. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud) watches the news from the airport and is disgusted because the news is more focused on his upcoming wedding to Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) than the strange events.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four board the plane now cleared for flight. Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) is obviously uncomfortable crammed into a Coach seat. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) suggests that the team get an endorsement and form their own private airline. He then leaves to fly himself back home as the Human Torch.<br/><br/>Back at the Baxter Building (the team\\'s headquarters), Sue and Reed discuss the details for their upcoming wedding. Johnny shows off his prototype new uniforms to the team (they are loaded with company logos and product placement). Johnny tries to snoop on Reed\\'s latest product while Reed explains that the global disturbances are being caused by a similar tyoeof cosmic radiation that originally gave the Fantastic Four their powers.<br/><br/>Johnny insists on throwing Reed a bachelor party. Reed is opposed to the idea, until Johnny blackmails him with the threat of telling Sue that Reed is spending more time researching disturbances than taking care of his end of the planning.<br/><br/>The mysterious entity passes over the nation of Latveria, and its residual energy frees Dr. Victor Von Doom (Julain McMahon) from his imprisonment.<br/><br/>Johnny takes Reed and Ben to a nightclub for Reed\\'s bachelor party. Reed and Ben are obviously uncomfortable (Reed because of his shyness, Ben because of his Thing powers).<br/><br/>A military force led by General Hagar (Andre Braugher) arrives at the Baxter Building to see Reed. Sue takes them to the club where they see Reed dancing (making full use of his Mr. Fantastic abilities) and Reed is embarassed.<br/><br/>Ben explains to Sue the history Reed has with General Hagar: Hagar had designed a new defense system several years ago, while Reed testified that the technology it called for was unreliable. General Hagar is concerned about the anomolies occurring worldwide, and shows the team sattelite photos of the mysterious entity. The generals\\' assistant, Captain Frankie Raye shows the team photos of craters that have been appearing in the same spots as the entities appearance. Hagar asks for a way to track the mysterious entity, but Reed turns him down because his wedding is in a few days. Johnny flirts with Captain Raye as they leave, but she shoots him down.<br/><br/>Later on, Ben finds out that Reed has decided to build the tracking system for the general anyway. Ben (and Johnny, who flies in when Reed is building) both agree to keep quiet.<br/><br/>The next day is the date of Sue and Reed\\'s wedding! Hundreds of guests file in (including a cameo by Fantastic Four creator Stan Lee).<br/><br/>Sue discusses her future with Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington), Ben\\'s blind girlfriend. Susan realizes that she has a zit on her forehead, but is able to conceal it with her Invisible Woman abilities.<br/><br/>Reed finishes the satellite tracking system less than an hour before the wedding begins. He is happy to have finished the project, but once Ben points out that he is about to be married, Reed goes limp with shock.<br/><br/>Johnny comes in and has a brief discussion with Ben about his relationship with Alicia, at which point Ben almost breaks Johnny\\'s skull out of anger and embaressment.<br/><br/>Victor Von Doom begins to track the mysterious entity, trying to figure out the power that brought him back to life.<br/><br/>As Reed &amp; Sue stand before the minister, Reed\\'s Palm Pilot goes off telling him that the sattelite tracker has come online. Sue is outraged that he lied to her. The entity then passes through New York City, causing a massive power outage and sending one of the news choppers covering the wedding flying towards the rooftop.<br/><br/>Sue uses her force field ability to block the chopper from hitting the guests. Ben jumps in and rips off the tail of the helicopter to prevent anyone from getting cut to pieces by the blades. As the entity passes overhead, Johnny shouts \"Flame ON!\" and gives chase.<br/><br/>The Human Torch follows the mysterious thing through the city and watches it pass through a building- thus getting his first look at The Silver Surfer (Doug Jones). Torch and Surfer begin an Ariel chase across half the country, but the Surfer ends it by grabbing Johnny by the throat and levitating him to the stratosphere, then sending Johnny flying back down to earth. Johnny is barely able to re-ignite his flame in time to stop crashing.<br/><br/>In space, the Silver Surfer contacts his master and awaits further orders.<br/><br/>Johnny describes the Silver Surfer to the team, who are skeptical at first. General Hagar orders Reed to find another way to track the Surfer.<br/><br/>Sue confronts Reed, worried that the two of them can never have a normal life if they continue to act as part-time superheroes. Sue is unsure if they can ever actually raise a family together.<br/><br/>Johnny, still dazed from his encounter with the Surfer, tries to fly but ends up falling off the building. Sue runs outside to check on him but when she touches his forehead Sue suddenly bursts into flames! Johnny shouts \"Flame ON\" but he only succeeds in turning invisible. Reed sees what has happened and runs outside. He suggests that Sue touch Johnny again, and they revert to their normal powers- though Sue is now naked after burning off her clothes.<br/><br/>Reed does a physical on them both and sees that Johnny\\'s molecules are in a state of flux, and that he may switch powers with any of them just by touch. Ben immediately takes advantage of this and grabs Johnny\\'s shoulder, turning him into the Thing! Johnny is appalled by his new appearance and grabs Ben, changing them both back.<br/><br/>Sue is still watching the news when she is joined by Reed. Reed announces that he has decided to give up being a hero once they are married. She is ecstatic, but Johnny overhears them and is angered.<br/><br/>Victor Von Doom calculates the next appearance of the Silver Surfer. He confronts the cosmic entity, suggesting a partnership between the two of them. The Surfer ignores Doom\\'s idea and blasts him with a burst of cosmic energy. Doom is angry, but then notices that the energy is restoring his normal organic appearance.<br/><br/>Johnny tells Ben about Reed &amp; Sue\\'s plan to leave. Ben is mad but decides that something like this is something that they can\\'t argue with.<br/><br/>Reed points out that the Silver Surfer\\'s energy has been tracked to several other planets, which are now lifeless husks. They realize that 8 days after the Surfer\\'s appearance on any world, that planet dies. Reed gets the idea to track the Surfer using the coordinates of the craters he leaves behind.<br/><br/>En route the the newest spot (in London), Johnny confronts Reed &amp; Sue about their decision and they argue.<br/><br/>The Surfer\\'s passing through causes The London Eye (London\\'s famous Ferris wheel) to be damaged, and many civilians are in danger. The Fantastic Four quickly rush to save them, with Johnny trying to chase the Surfer again. But Johnny accidentally collides with Reed and they switch powers. Ben &amp; Sue almost let the Ferris wheel collapse before Reed gets the idea to use Human Torch\\'s power to weld it back into place. Reed sets back down and quickly reclaims his rightful power from Johnny, angry that Johnny\\'s recklessness almost killed a lot of people-including Sue.<br/><br/>General Hagar is outraged at the Fantastic Four\\'s failure. He has decided to get extra help: Victor Von Doom. Ben, outraged that their old foe is still alive, attacks. Reed convinces Ben to back off, and asks what Victor has to contribute.<br/><br/>Victor shows a recording of his previous encounter with the Silver Surfer. They observe that the Surfer\\'s energy attack originated from his board, and theorize that if they can divide him from the board the Surfer will be vulnerable.<br/><br/>Johnny and Ben spend the night at a bar, discussing the turn of events. Johnny asks Ben what he wants to do if the world is indeed coming to an end. Ben admits that part of him would want to go down fighting, but he mostly would want to spend his last moments with Alicia. Johnny agrees, apparently jealous that Ben has someone so special to him.<br/><br/>Reed has surrounded himself with databases, working around the clock to find the solution without Victor\\'s help. Sue comes in and reassures him, ordering Reed to relax. Sue mentions that Reed\\'s pulse must be overexerted, and the word \"pulse\" inspires Reed: he can create an energy pulse generated by a power field to divide the Surfer from his board. Reed requests some equipment from General Hagar to build the power field.<br/><br/>Sue confronts Victor about his intentions and his return. Meanwhile, Johnny flirts with Frankie again but she blows him off as a reckless jokester.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four arrive at the newest coordinates and begin to set up the pulse generators. Ben has a humorous confrontation with a bear when setting up his section of the generator.<br/><br/>Susan is setting up her generator when the Silver Surfer appears in front of her. Sue approaches the Surfer, asking him why he is working to destroy the planet. The Surfer claims that he has no choice; that he is not the destroyer but merely a beacon.<br/><br/>General Harding spots the Surfer and opens fire. Silver Surfer merely swats down the missiles with his cosmic powers. Reed activates the pulse system, knocking the Surfer off his board (and in the process turning his body from bright silver to a dull, tarnished gray).<br/><br/>General Harding brings the Surfer and the board to a hideout in Siberia for further study. He places the Fantastic Four under \"house arrest\" until they are finished studying. Sue decides to go out and confront the Surfer. She asks him who the real destroyer is, and the Surfer responds (showing her an image) that the true destroyer is his master, a vast cosmic entity known by many names and forms which his people refer to as Galactus. The Silver Surfer explains that his service spares his homeworld from the destroyer. Surfer explains that he is compassionate towards Sue because she reminds him of his beloved.<br/><br/>Out in space, a vast cloud is shown moving towards Earth. The destroyer is drawing closer.<br/><br/>Victor is permitted to do tests on the board. He uses a special device to free the board from its confinement and bond with it. General Hager tries to stop him, but Doom blasts him with his new cosmic energy and vaporises the general.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four escape from confinement, also freeing the Silver Surfer. Frankie is reluctant to let them leave, but Johnny pleads with her and he manages to convince her.<br/><br/>As they get outside, Reed summons his new invention- the FantastiCar, a flying hovercraft for the team. Reed, Sue, Ben and the Surfer climb in (Johnny flies along beside them). The Silver Surfer confesses his real name- Norrin Radd. He agrees to try and help them.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four track Victor to Southeast China, and attack. They are able to lure him over the land, but must abandon the FantastiCar after he attacks it. Norrin confronts Doom, who fashions a javelin from the board\\'s energy and hurls it at him. Sue steps in front of Norrin, conjuring up a force field to protect them both, but the javelin passes right through the force field and impales Sue, mortally wounding her. Seeing no other option, Johnny suggests that all of the other team members transfer their powers to him. They argue, but Norrin points out that they have no other choice- Galactus has arrived, and is extending its tendrils into the planet to devour it.<br/><br/>Reed tells Johnny to aim for the remote emitter Doom is using to connect himself to the board. Ben, remembering his thought of going down fighting, takes control of a giant crane and uses it to attack Doom. The combined efforts of the team\\'s powers is successful and Doom crashes into the ocean, sinking out of sight.<br/><br/>Norrin re-connects with his board, and infuses Sue with a small part of his cosmic energy, restoring her to life. The Silver Surfer tells Reed to treasure every moment with Sue, and flies off to face the cosmic entity. He is joined midway by Johnny, who uses the last of his combined powers to give the Silver Surfer a boost into the cosmic storm.<br/><br/>In the heart of the cloud, Silver Surfer tells Galactus that he will no longer be a servent. Norrin Radd charges up a massive amount of cosmic energy and then releases a huge blast, stopping the cosmic entity by apparently destroying them both.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four, including the revived Sue, are thrilled to see that the destruction of the planet has stopped but saddened by the loss of the Surfer. Johnny accidentally comes into contact with Ben, but is shocked to see that nothing happened. To everyone\\'s relief, Johnny\\'s second encounter with the Surfer has restored his powers to normal.<br/><br/>Sue reveals that she has decided against her past ideas and does not want to break up the team, since they just saved the world together. Reed agrees that they cannot run away from their responsibilities and that people do not have to be \"Normal\" to have a family. Reed also has an idea regarding the prospect of a wedding.<br/><br/>Sue and Reed decide to hold a Shinto-style wedding while they are still in China. They must rush through the ceremony when Reed\\'s pager alerts them of new danger. Sue tosses the bouquet to the women in the audience (including Frankie, who apparently has decided to pursue a relationship with Johnny). When it looks as if Frankie might catch the bouquet, Johnny \"accidentally\" sneezes and burns up the flowers.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four boards their newly restored Fantasticar and speeds off to another adventure!!!<br/><br/>In a bonus scene partway through the credits, the Surfer and his board are seen floating through space. The Surfer appears to be dead after his encounter with Galactus. But suddenly the Surfer\\'s board turns and begins to move toward him.</div></div>'}\n",

What she doesn\\'t realize is that if she sacrificed herself the world they know may change forever.<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=honey_a&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_5\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">honey_a</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">Picking up shortly where the first film, \\'Divergent\\' ended, Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet) sends a message to every faction in the city. She says that after the war, peace seemed unattainable. Now, she feels the opposite way, and that peace can be achieved so long as they purge the city of their one enemy - the Divergents. At the same time, Jeanine\\'s men go to the Prior home in Abnegation and retrieve a box with a symbol of each faction on it, holding what is believed to be a message from the founders of the city. They need a Divergent to unlock it.<br/><br/>Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) runs back to her home in Amity with her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and lover Four (Theo James). She approaches the residents of Amity, but they all stand away from her. Tris sees her parents Andrew (Tony Goldwyn) and Natalie (Ashley Judd) bloodied, and Natalie says that Tris killed her and all of the people around her. This is only a nightmare. In reality, Tris is adjusting to Amity with Caleb, Four, Peter (Miles Teller), and Four\\'s father Marcus (Ray Stevenson). Four remains distant from Marcus, despite how much he wants to talk to his son.<br/><br/>During lunch, Tris talks about wanting to go back to Erudite and kill Jeanine to prevent more deaths from happening. Caleb argues that this is a bad idea. Peter makes a comment on not getting Caleb killed, just like how Tris got her parents killed. Enraged, Tris attacks Peter with a knife, cutting his cheek. The leader of Amity, Johanna Reyes (Octavia Spencer) calls Tris to her office, saying that her presence in what is supposed to be a peaceful community is distracting and that they may be asked to leave. Johanna warns Tris not to let her want for revenge get ahold of her. Then, a team of vans, led by Eric (Jai Courtney) and Max (Mekhi Phifer), comes bursting through the gates, hunting for Divergents. Tris, Four, and Caleb hide in the office, but Peter rats them out, forcing them to make a run for it. The soldiers aim their guns at them, and Marcus stands in their way, leading to him getting knocked out as Four watches. The three evade the soldiers and make it down to the train-tracks. Four holds the soldiers off and just manages to jump over the tracks before the train hits him.<br/><br/>The three hop the train and encounter a large group of Factionless people led by Edgar (Jonny Weston). They violently attack the three after Edgar almost pushes Caleb off the train. In self-defense, Caleb ends up beating one Factionless to death, horrifying him. They stop attacking when Four says his name is Tobias Eaton. Knowing who he is, the Factionless take the three to their leader and Four\\'s mother, Evelyn (Naomi Watts). She explains that she faked her death when Four was six because Marcus was too abusive, but she regrets leaving her son behind. Her plan is to unite the Factionless and Dauntless to fight back against Jeanine and her forces. Four refuses to have any part in his mother\\'s plans.<br/><br/>That night, Tris is sleeping with Four, when Evelyn appears in the doorway. She sits by the bed and asks Tris if she thinks he will still love her when he realizes what she really is - deadly. Tris then sees Four bloodied by her side. It\\'s another nightmare.<br/><br/>The next morning, Tris and Four head to Candor, but Caleb heads in another direction. In Candor, Tris and Four reunite with the surviving Dauntless, including Christina (Zoe Kravitz) and Tori (Maggie Q). Christina asks Tris if she\\'s heard from their friend Will, unaware that Tris had to kill him in his hypnotic state. Tris says she hasn\\'t heard anything. Tris and Four are then apprehended and brought before the Candor leader Jack Kang (Daniel Dae Kim). He doesn\\'t believe that they are truthful in what they say about Jeanine issuing the attacks and then framing them for crimes she committed. Four convinces Jack to let the two of them stand trial.<br/><br/>Four is injected with a truth serum and stands before the Candors. He tells them how he joined Dauntless to escape his father\\'s abuse and that he planned to join the Factionless until he fell in love with Tris. Tris goes up with the serum in her, but the more she resists telling the truth, the more it pains her. She then admits that she was responsible for the deaths of many, including her parents and Will, to the shock and anger of Christina.<br/><br/>Back in Erudite, Jeanine is testing Divergents out to see who can unlock the box. She has a girl put in a simulation, but the girl dies. Jeanine determines that a particularly special Divergent must be brought to complete the task. Peter comes in and swears loyalty to Erudite. He tells Jeanine the best way to get Tris to give herself up is to play to her humanity.<br/><br/>Tris stands on a rooftop where she is approached by a young man named Uriah (Keiynan Lonsdale). He engages in pleasant conversation with Tris when Eric and his soldiers invade and start shooting the Candors with a sim serum to the neck. He has people lined up and starts to scan them to see which Divergent it is that they need. Eric scans Uriah and sees he is 10% Divergent, and he executes him. Eric then scans a little girl who is 40% Divergent. Before he can shoot her, Tris pushes him over. Max comes over to scan Tris and sees she is 100% Divergent. Four shows up and fights Eric, bringing him to his knees with a gun to his head. Eric asks if Four can live with killing someone the way Eric already has. Four shoots him in the head.<br/><br/>The sim serums activate on Christina, a young boy, and a girl named Marlene (Suki Waterhouse) as they stand over a ledge. They chant in unison for Tris to turn herself in or more will die. The three of them move closer as Tris and Tori run to rescue them. Tris grabs Christina and Tori grabs the boy, but Marlene falls over to her death.<br/><br/>Four returns to Factionless to join his mother\\'s cause against Erudite. A guilt-ridden Tris decides that she must turn herself in to Jeanine if she wants to prevent anymore deaths. Once she gets to Erudite, she is immediately taken in and brought to the sim room.<br/><br/>Caleb, having rejoined Erudite, meets Tris in the sim room before it commences. He claims it is selfless of him to allow his sister to risk herself for the good of many. Tris is stuck with multiple wires and must go through a simulation of every faction to unlock the box. Her first test is a Dauntless sim. She is in the ruins of the city where she sees her mother in a building. The building catches fire, and Natalie calls Tris for help. Tris runs to her as the building starts to float into the air. She grabs a pipe and climbs to the top. She falls off briefly but manages to catch up and climb into the home to grab onto her mother. After she passes this, she must go through the Candor sim, in which she confesses to a sim of her mother that she is scared most of the time and just wishes to be safe again. All of a sudden, Four appears, breaking her out with others behind him. Tris gets a gun and faces Peter on the floor. She spares his life and keeps going. She then realizes that Four isn\\'t real, and she passes the sim, belonging to Erudite. She also passed the Abnegation sim by sparing Peter\\'s life. Tris starts to lose energy, and Jeanine reluctantly allows her to rest up before continuing.<br/><br/>When the tests continue, Tris is put in the Amity sim, which puts her in a confrontation with Jeanine. Tris attacks her, and the building around her explodes and collapses, and she hit the ground after falling hundreds of feet. This causes her to appear dead, to Jeanine\\'s frustration. Peter brings Tris\\'s motionless body to Four, who reacts angrily toward Peter. Tris then gasps a breath of air, and Peter leads Four to attack the guards, now helping the heroes out.<br/><br/>Peter gets into the computer system and lets Tris go through the Amity sim again. This time, she is forced to fight herself, as she is the one person she hates more than Jeanine. Sim-Tris taunts Real Tris over the deaths of her loved ones, but Real Tris knows she will eventually be able to forgive herself. After she passes this, the box is unlocked. Everyone sees what the message is - a woman (Janet McTeer) says that everyone in the city was part of an experiment to see if humanity can continue to thrive, and that the true saviors of this world would be the Divergents, so if one were to unlock this message, it would mean everyone is ready to go beyond the walls of the city. Knowing this would eliminate her power, Jeanine orders the box to be hidden from everyone, and for Tris and Four to be executed. The Factionless army then invades, seizing Jeanine and the box.<br/><br/>The message is played throughout all the factions. Everybody starts heading toward the walls and outside the city. Tris is seen as a hero for leading them to a new discovery. Meanwhile, Jeanine watches from the window in her cell as everybody advances beyond the city. Evelyn comes in behind her. Jeanine says that after 200 years since the city came to be, she wonders what could be out there. Evelyn tells her she\\'ll never find out, and she kills Jeanine with a bullet to the back of the head.</div></div>'}\n",

They hand him an alien staff, before transforming together into Dragonstorm and turn the tide of the battle, but warn Merlin that a great evil will come for the staff. In the present, a year after the Hong Kong uprising, Optimus Prime crash-lands on Cybertron and meets his alleged creator Quintessa. She blames him for Cybertron\\'s destruction and brainwashes him into helping to gain Merlin\\'s staff, which can absorb Earth\\'s energy to restore Cybertron. Optimus is renamed Nemesis Prime. Earth is revealed to be the slumbering Unicron, the ancient enemy of Cybertron and whose horns are emerging across the planet.</div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">This fifth Transformers film opens in England during the Dark Ages. King Arthur (Liam Garrigan) and his knights are all in the middle of an epic battle, but their side is losing and being crushed by gigantic fireballs. Arthur awaits his last hope, his chief adviser and wizard Merlin (Stanley Tucci), to save them. The other knights dismiss Merlin as nothing more than a drunk. After downing his drink, Merlin finds a Cybertronian Knight and asks for his help in the fight. The Knight presents Merlin with a powerful staff that will allow him to control Dragonstorm. Merlin wields the staff, which brings Dragonstorm down to help Arthur and his army lay waste to their enemies.<br/><br/>In the present day, Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) has been lost in his mission to seek out his creators. He is seen floating through space while frozen.<br/><br/>On planet Earth, the Transformers have been deemed illegal since the battle in Hong Kong (in the fourth film). Most of the Autobots have gone into hiding, with Topspin hiding out somewhere in Cuba with Agent Simmons (John Turturro). The Transformers Reaction Force, led by Santos (Santiago Cabrera), has been active for the last few years to eliminate any Transformers they come across.<br/><br/>A NASA engineer (Tony Hale) detects something heading toward Earth in a matter of three days. It\\'s the planet Cybertron.<br/><br/>In Chicago, a group of kids run toward the city\\'s ruins and find a pod containing a Cybertronian Knight. Moments later, a TRF sentinel stomps around and attacks the kids. The sentinel is destroyed by an Autobot named Canopy, belonging to a young girl named Izabella (Isabela Moner), who also takes care of a little Autobot named Sqweeks (voice of Reno Wilson). A TRF drone then strikes Canopy down. Despite Izabella pleading with Canopy to stay strong, he dies. Bumblebee then arrives to take out the drone. He is followed by Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg), who has been in hiding for siding with the Autobots. Not long after, Santos and his men show up to try and apprehend Cade. Bumblebee splits himself into multiple pieces to fight back against the TRF agents. Cade then has Santos pinned to the ground with a gun aimed at him, but he is stopped by William Lennox (Josh Duhamel), who now works with TRF. Lennox talks Cade out of doing anything to Santos. After their confrontation, Cade goes to the Knight in his pod. The Knight dies, but not before giving Cade a talisman that grants him a special power. Meanwhile, the Decepticon Barricade has witnessed all this while disguised as a police cruiser.<br/><br/>Optimus crash-lands in what\\'s left of Cybertron. He is held down by the Infernocons. Optimus is approached by Quintessa (voice of Gemma Chan), who is apparently one of Cybertron\\'s creators. Optimus tries to go after her, but she is able to hold him back as they both claim that the other has betrayed their fellow Transformers. Quintessa has Optimus under her control, and she tells him that Earth is really a disguised form of Cybertron\\'s great enemy Unicron. She corrupts Optimus and tells him that in order for Cybertron to live, Earth must be destroyed. Quintessa uses this to give Optimus a chance at redemption, which he accepts.<br/><br/>Back on Earth, Lennox reports to his superior, General Morshower (Glenn Morshower), about the impending impact with Cybertron. They learn that the newly-resurrected Megatron (voice of Frank Welker) is seeking the talisman that Cade has. The TRF reluctantly makes a deal with Megatron to release his fellow Decepticons from an underground prison. Megatron requests Mohawk, Nitro Zeus, and Onslaught. Megatron also requests Dreadbot and Berserker, but the TRF thinks they are too risky to be let out.<br/><br/>In England, Oxford professor Viviane Wembley (Laura Haddock) is playing a game with her colleagues and she wins, but is frequently reminded by her male colleagues, plus her mother and mother\\'s friends, that she\\'s single. Viviane leads a tour in an Arthurian museum, telling her students about the lore and myth surrounding these stories, and bluntly saying that it\\'s all bullshit.<br/><br/>Cade goes to a junkyard where his friend Jimmy (Jerrod Carmichael) is helping him hide the Autobots - Hound (voice of John Goodman), Drift (voice of Ken Watanabe), Crosshairs (voice of John DiMaggio), Wheelie (voice of Tom Kenny), Daytrader (voice of Steve Buscemi), and Grimlock. Jimmy complains that Grimlock is hard to handle. Cade has been followed by Izabella and Sqweeks. Although Cade tries to turn her away, she tells him that she has nowhere to go because Decepticons killed her family, so all she had were Canopy and Sqweeks, and now Canopy is dead. Cade allows her to stay. He then goes to call his daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) while she is at college, but he is unable to speak for fear that he may be found by TRF. Tessa tells him that she is fine and that she loves him, but also that he needs to find himself a girlfriend.<br/><br/>Megatron and his goons arrive at the junkyard to find the talisman and kill the Autobots. The Autobots come out of hiding and start fighting the Decepticons. Onslaught and Mohawk are both quickly blasted to pieces. As Cade runs away, he is found by a small humanoid Transformer named Cogman (Jim Carter). He is looking for Cade but nearly loses him when Cade is attacked by a drone. He still gets Cade to go with him eventually.<br/><br/>Viviane is taken by the Autobot Hot Rod (Omar Sy) to the mansion of Sir Edmund Burton (Anthony Hopkins), where she also meets Cade and Cogman. Burton explains to Cade and Viviane the legacy of the Witwiccan Order, having started since the time of King Arthur. Throughout history, the Transformers have been working in the background to help humanity, and the Witwiccans (including Sam Witwicky) have been doing their part to keep the Transformers protected. In a flashback, we see the Transformers helping American soldiers fight against the Nazis in World War II. Burton also mentions the Staff of Merlin, which only a descendant of Merlin\\'s can wield. He reveals to Viviane that she is the last descendant, and her father had kept this a secret from her up until his death. She needs to wield it to prevent something catastrophic from hitting Earth. Burton then explains the talisman, which has wrapped itself around Cade. It chose him because it considers him an honorable man.<br/><br/>TRF agents show up and force everyone out of Burton\\'s mansion. Hot Rod holds them off for a brief moment by trapping them in a time-contained bubble.<br/><br/>Cade, Viviane, Cogman, Burton, and Bumblebee locate the old submarine HMS Alliance with the help of Simmons (who wants to be an honorary member of the Order) to help them locate the Staff. They are taken to the bottom of the ocean where they find a machine and the Staff in a chamber of Knights. The Knight Skullitron awakens and attacks everyone. The other Knights rise and start to fight just as TRF soldiers show up as well. Viviane goes for the Staff, which brings the machine up to the surface.<br/><br/>Optimus shows up to take the Staff and give it to Quintessa so that she can activate the machine and use it to take Earth\\'s core energy and transfer it to Cybertron, which would fry all human life. Optimus then fights Bumblebee while still under Quintessa\\'s control. Before Optimus can strike a fatal blow, Bumblebee\\'s voice comes back at the most convenient time to snap Optimus out of his control and remind him who he really is. Although Optimus is good again, the other Knights attempt to attack for his attempted betrayal. Cade steps in with the talisman, which (somehow) gives him the power to wield Excalibur. The Knights yield to Cade.<br/><br/>The final battle comes to Stonehenge, where Megatron and Quintessa initiate their attack on Earth. Cybertron begins to tear through various parts of Earth. The TRF decide to join forces with the Autobots. Also arriving to the fight are Jimmy, Izabella, and the rest of the Autobots. In the chaos, Megatron kills Burton, who dies with Cogman by his side. As the heroes attempt to stop the machine, Quintessa sends out the Infernocons and a massive gun shooting at them. Lennox tries to pull everyone back as it is way too risky. Izabella sends Sqweeks out to destroy the gun, giving everyone a chance to fight. The Infernocons go after Optimus, but he decapitates all of them with one swift motion.<br/><br/>Within Cybertron, the Autobots fight against Megatron while Viviane attempts to regain the Staff. Optimus chops off Megatron\\'s arm before he kills again, and then Optimus kicks Megatron out and sends him plummeting back to Earth. Viviane nearly falls to her doom but Hot Rod freezes time again and helps her get closer to the Staff. Optimus confronts Quintessa, who holds him back again until Bumblebee comes from behind and seemingly destroys her. Viviane then takes control of the Staff and stops the machine, saving the Earth.<br/><br/>Earth is saved once again. Cade and Viviane make plans to go on a date, and Cade takes Izabella in so she can have a real family again. Optimus sends a call to all Autobots as he realizes that Earth has been and always will be his home.<br/><br/>During the closing credits, a team of scientists are gathered around a site. Quintessa is alive and takes a human disguise to approach one of them, saying she has a way to destroy Unicron. We then see what appears to be a massive mechanical horn sticking out of the ground.</div></div>'}\n",

Then an old pickup truck comes hauling out of the mine shaft and down a desolate rural road. The driver is a bearded elderly man (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm3967796/?ref_=ttpl\">Oliver Cooper</a>) obscured in the darkness of his truck\\'s cabin. He looks down at the passenger seat and touches a ghost trap that\\'s holding a spirit. His truck is being chased by an unseen creature that is eventually able to sideswipe the vehicle and send it crashing into a cornfield. The man stumbles out into an open field in front of an old farm house. He gets to the porch and turns around and holds up the trap baiting the unseen spirit in the corn field. The old man is Egon Spengler and he readies a foot pedal switch as invisible steps are seen advancing in the dirt across the field. When it is in position, Egon stomps the pedal and several electric towers begin to activate. But they short out before powering on the device they were intended for and Egon quickly goes inside and shuts the door. He hides the trap in a compartment under the wood floor and then sits in a chair with his PKE meter. As fog fills the room, his PKE begins to light up and it\\'s arms extend reminiscent of when a ghost is present. Egon is attacked in his chair and the PKE meter falls to the floor and turns off. A spirit orb is seen leaving the house from outside. Back in the house, the PKE meter activates again eluding to a new ghost nearby.<br/><br/>We meet Callie (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm4689420/?ref_=ttpl\">Carrie Coon</a>) and her kids Trevor (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm6016511/?ref_=ttpl\">Finn Wolfhard</a>) and Phoebe (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm5085683/?ref_=ttpl\">Mckenna Grace</a>) as they are getting evicted from their apartment. Callie gets notice that her father has passed away in his farmhouse in Oklahoma and takes the kids with her to collect anything of value including the home. They find a dilapidated house full of clutter. As they\\'re looking around, Janine (the Ghostbusters\\' receptionist) walks in and tells them that Callie\\'s dad (Egon) had a lot of debt and a valueless farm. The ground begins to shake in what appears to be tremors from an earthquake, and the family huddle under a table. Phoebe spots the PKE meter under the chair her grandfather was in when he died.<br/><br/>Callie takes Trevor and Phoebe into town to eat after she admits to them that they will be staying there for a while until she can figure out what to do. They find that it\\'s a very small southern town where everyone knew of the mysterious man they all called \"the dirt farmer\" since there was no evidence he ever grew any crops. Trevor applies to work at the burger joint because he is smitten with the girl who works there named Lucky (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm9305936/?ref_=ttpl\">Celeste O\\'Connor</a>).<br/><br/>In the following days Phoebe begins exploring the farm while using the PKE meter. She notices a chess board with an initial move made so she makes a move from her side of the board. Callie starts Phoebe in summer school and meets her teacher Gary (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0748620/?ref_=ttpl\">Paul Rudd</a>) as she drops her off. Gary is just there to collect a paycheck and has the kids watch VHS\\'s of old horror movies (the first one being <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/title/tt0085382/?ref_=ttpl\">Cujo (1983)</a>) while he sits in the back doing research on the ongoing tremors in the area. Phoebe impresses him with her knowledge on Seismology and he explains to her that the tremor wave patterns don\\'t match up with typical earthquakes from history. Phoebe also meets a boy in her class who calls himself \"Podcast\" (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm10594234/?ref_=ttpl\">Logan Kim</a>) since he\\'s always recording for his show with his microphone.<br/><br/>Back at the farmhouse, Phoebe sees that another move is made on the chess board and begins playing the ghost as the chess pieces begin moving in front of her. The ghost leads her downstairs by turning on lights until she finds the ghost trap under a floor panel. She takes it to Gary where he explains what it is based on his knowledge of the famed New York siege from 1984. He shows her and Podcast old footage of the Ghostbusters commercial on YouTube. They rig the trap to a school bus battery to get it to open. They succeed and a ghost resembling one of the demon dogs from the original flies away.<br/><br/>Revelations come to fruition as Trevor finds Ecto-1 in the barn under a tarp and Phoebe finds Egon\\'s lab in the basement. They both realize that their grandfather was a Ghostbuster and begin to take matters into their own hands. Phoebe repairs a proton blaster with help from Egon\\'s invisible ghost and takes it out for a test with Podcast tagging along. Upon firing it, they hear a rustling in a nearby warehouse. They find the metal eating ghost named Muncher. They attempt to wrangle and capture him but fail. Meanwhile, Trevor repairs Ecto-1 and takes it for a joy ride where he comes upon Phoebe and Podcast who tell him what they were doing. The trio take off to capture Muncher in Ecto-1. They chase him thru the city and destroy tons of property with the proton gun. They succeed in capturing it with Egon\\'s RC car mounted ghost trap. All the chaos alerted the police and they are subsequently pulled over and put in the town\\'s holding cell. During their time at the jailhouse, Phoebe uses her \"one phone call\" option to call the number of the Ghostbusters from the commercial. Ray Stantz answers and explains that the team broke up after they had ostensibly eliminated all the ghosts. He and Egon had a falling out after Egon stole all their equipment claiming Gozer could still bring the end of the world. Phoebe tells him that Egon was killed a week ago before she is abruptly cut off by the sheriff claiming her phone time is up. Callie and Gary -who were out on a date during all of this- show up and bail them out.<br/><br/>Phoebe confronts her mom for not telling her who their grandfather really was. Callie counters with the history she had with her dad. She wasn\\'t into science like he was and felt like they never bonded and he didn\\'t care about her. That\\'s why he left them and became a recluse on the Oklahoma farm she concluded.<br/><br/>The kids -feeling there\\'s got to be a reason their grandfather would sacrifice everything to live on a farm in the middle of nowhere- find in his lab that his \"dirt farm\" was actually a field of hundreds of ghost traps meant to capture Gozer. They realize that his trap must have failed and set off to investigate the mine shaft once more. By this time Lucky has become close with Trevor thru work and the discovery that she is the sheriff\\'s daughter. So she tags along to the mine with Trevor, Phoebe, and Podcast. They discover the root of all the tremors is the fact that the mine is actually a portal to the evil dead and every time Gozer attempts to raise the hoard of ghosts -along with the twin demon dogs- a series of 4 seismic activated proton guns that Egon rigged up inside turn on. They automatically cross beams and suppress the constant attempts of the ghosts trying to escape. This was the source of the recurrent tremors everyone in town was experiencing and holding Gozer back was the insurmountable task Egon had taken on alone since no one else believes him.<br/><br/>That same night, Gary goes to Walmart to pick up some ice cream after his unusual date with Callie. He discovers several mini StayPuft marshmallow men roaming the store causing chaos like a bunch of gremlins. He comes upon the demon dog he released earlier and gets chased out to his car and attacked just like the scene from Cujo. Back at the farmhouse, Callie finds the hidden lab and discovers that her father Egon had a memory board of all her life on the wall. Just as she realizes that he truly cared about her, the other demon dog finds her in the lab and possesses her.<br/><br/>The kids come home to reveal their discovery to Callie but find her possessed, before she jumps out the window and runs off towards the mine shaft. She finds Gary, who has already allowed the ghosts to start escaping by damaging the auto-proton guns that were keeping them at bay. The two \"merge energies\" in the mine. The kids retrieve Ecto-1 from the police impound with Lucky\\'s help. Phoebe and Podcast are able to get the RC ghost trap and proton blaster out from the weapon holding cell by reaching in and releasing Muncher who immediately eats away the bars and escapes.<br/><br/>They arrive at the mine and witness Callie and Gary transforming into the demon dog forms with Gozer sitting between them. Phoebe steps out from hiding to talk to and distract Gozer while Podcast controls the RC trap and captures the demon dog possessing Callie. This releases her from dog form as she passes out. The kids escape in Ecto-1 with Callie as the Gary -still possessed in dog form- chases after them.<br/><br/>They make their way to the farmhouse and attempt the same trap as Egon. Callie and Phoebe stand on the porch holding the ghost trap with the demon dog that Gozer needs to become fully resurrected. Gozer appears out of the corn field and Phoebe tries to turn on the traps but they fail again just as they had the first time with Egon. Some mini StayPuft marshmallow men sabotage the equipment inside Ecto-1, which allows Gozer to release the demon dog from the ghost trap. The freed dog possesses Lucky. Just as Gozer, now back to full strength, is about to kill Phoebe, she is hit with a proton blast from behind. It\\'s Ray Stantz who had just arrived with Peter Venkman and Winston Zeddemore! The three original Ghostbusters cross the beams and fire at Gozer. She appears subdued but then begins uncrossing the beams and blasts the Ghostbusters back causing them all to fall down. Gozer approaches them as Peter jokingly complains about the inherent troubles in their relationship. Just as she reaches them she is again captured by a sole proton beam. This time it\\'s Phoebe, whose aim is being guided by the ghost of Egon. This is the first time his image is revealed to the audience.<br/><br/>The other three Ghostbusters jump up and join the battle by firing their beams as well. With the combined force of four beams once again, Gozer is suppressed but not captured. Meanwhile, Trevor and Podcast have been able to defeat the mini-Pufts and repair the sabotaged equipment, allowing Trevor to emerge from Ecto-1 and fire his proton beam at the electrical capacitors. The burst of energy charges them up. Callie throws the switch to try to turn the traps on again, and this time they successfully activate, capturing Gozer and the demon dogs.<br/><br/>The other three original Ghostbusters stare in amazement at the sight of the ghost form of their fallen comrade. They watch as he says goodbye, fixes Phoebe\\'s glasses -identical to his- and gives Callie a hug. Having reconciled with his family, Egon\\'s form fades and dissipates into the night sky. Lucky and Gary break free of the frozen dog carcasses, and the three surviving original Ghostbusters become acquainted with the Spenglers, before Winston tells them that he will fix up Ecto-1, and the three original Ghostbusters take it and their equipment back to New York City. We see an overhead shot of Ecto-1 driving with emergency lights on across a bridge in New York City as the theme song \"Ghostbusters\" begins.<br/><br/>There is a mid-credits scene where Dana Barrett Venkman (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000244/?ref_=ttpl\">Sigourney Weaver</a>) tests Peter Venkman\\'s psychic powers with the same patterned cards and electro-shock machine Peter had used in his University research before he became a Ghostbuster, and a post-credits scene shows a brief conversation between Winston, who is now the wealthy head of his family, and Janine, in which Winston mentions that he has been using his resources to maintain the Ghostbusters\\' properties, including Ray\\'s Occult Bookstore and the fire station that had originally served as the Ghostbusters\\' headquarters. This is followed by Winston opening the fire station\\'s door to allow Ecto-1 to be driven back inside, after which we see a shot of the basement\\'s containment system with a blinking red light.</div></div>'}\n",

Professor Sherman Klump (also Eddie Murphy), a kindly, well-liked, brilliant professor of genetics, gets ready for work. Meanwhile, 5,000 hamsters are overrunning Wellman College and causing general chaos. It turns out that these are the school\\'s laboratory hamsters that 400-pound Sherman accidentally released the night before, his fat belly hitting the button that opens the cages when he turned around away from. The problem having been contained, Sherman is given an update by his assistant, Jason (John Ales), about their latest project an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person to make weight-loss easy. It seems that their fattest hamster, Shelley, has lost 3 ounces, proving that the serum works. Jason suggests increasing the amount Shelley is fed, but the ever-kindly Sherman argues against it, saying it could be dangerous.<br/><br/>He then has an unpleasant meeting with Dean Richmond (Larry Miller). The Dean tells him that the incident with the hamsters has cost the science department most of its funding. Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is the school\\'s last remaining wealthy alumnus and is planning to award a $10 million grant to the college; Klump is warned not to alienate him as well.<br/><br/>After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with the lovely Miss Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett), a chemistry graduate student teaching a class across the hall, who is a big fan of his work. Later that night, Sherman dines with his obese and ill-mannered family (most of whom are also played by Murphy). After noticing that he\\'s taking very small amounts of food from the table, Sherman reveals that he\\'s trying to watch his weight and avoid the calories. His father, Cletus, scoffs him, believing that there\\'s nothing wrong with being fat and that while Sherman can do whatever he can, he\\'ll never get rid of his fat. After his mother, Anna, brings up Colon Cleansing she saw about on T.V., Cletus starts his habit of randomly passing gas, much to the humor of Ernie Sr. and Jr., but to the disgust of Sherman, Grandma, and Anna. Treating this disgraceful procedure religiously, he breaks wind to the point where he has soiled himself (6 times). Sherman is hurt by the comments Cletus makes, but Anna, tells him that he is \"beautiful inside and out,\" saying that he can do anything if he just believes in himself. This prompts Sherman to attempt to ask Carla out on a date, which she accepts, much to his surprise.<br/><br/>While watching Lance Perkins on TV giving one his speeches of motivation, Sherman falls asleep and dreams he is making out with Carla on a beach, but she gets buried in the sand by his weight. Sherman awakens to Perkins telling the viewers to get up and tell themselves \"Yes I can!\", which Sherman does. Now Sherman is motivated, full of energy, and is determined to lose some weight. A Rocky-style montage ensues, showing Sherman trying various methods to get fit before the big date. However, although the date begins well with Carla showing great admiration for Sherman\\'s work with Shelley. Suddenly, an insult comic called Reggie Warrington (Dave Chappelle), takes over as the show\\'s entertainer after the singers are done with their performance. Reggie heckles many of the other patrons for their odd appearances. Realizing he\\'ll be next, Sherman tries to leave the scene, however, he only catches Reggie\\'s attention sooner, heckling him mercilessly with cruel jokes about his obesity, ruining his night. Back at Carla\\'s home with tears in his eyes, a deeply hurt and humiliated Sherman says goodbye to his date. Carla insults Reggie for what he did to him and tells Sherman that he is brilliant. Sherman tells her to have a pleasant evening and shakes her hand.<br/><br/>Later that night, alone and depressed at home, Sherman stuffs himself with junk food while watching Perkins console a fat woman, who tells a sad story about how a man from a fraternity asked her out as an excuse to make fun of her obesity. Sherman dozes off in front of the TV set and has another nightmare in which he becomes a giant, with Reggie being present insulting him again, his mother offering him fried chicken, and his father supporting his fat weight. He lays waste to the city with a single fart which is accidentally lit, causing the town to explode. When he wakes, he finally yields to the temptation to try his new serum on himself. It seems to work perfectly: in seconds, he loses 300 pounds and becomes slim and fit. He goes out, all excited, hyped, and overjoyed with his new transformation, celebrating buying slim clothes for himself, especially spandex, peforming excercising classes perfectly, and just randomly shouting out the fact that he\\'s thin.<br/><br/>The following day, while still slim, he starts to flirt with Carla, who comes to the lab looking for Sherman. Quickly inventing the name \"Buddy Love\" for his new alter ego - based on a security guard\\'s saying \"Hey, buddy, what the hell happened here?\". Although \\'Love\\' is his own contribution, he invites Carla back to The Scream. However, the serum then begins to wear off (i.e. one hand bulking up and his voice returning to normal) and he ushers Carla out. Carla later tells Sherman about Buddy and Sherman encourages her to go out with him. At The Scream, Buddy turns up very late in a brand new Dodge Viper and an angry Carla about to leave. The hyperactive Buddy obnoxiously begs her to go back inside with him, which she gives up to. This time, when Reggie appears, and starts his revenge against Reggie, by heckling him about his appearance mercilessly. Reggie tries to start firing off Yo Mama jokes to stupe him, however, Buddy once again overpowers him and takes the stage from Reggie. Finally pissed off, Reggie tries challenging Buddy to a Karate match, but he is once again overpowered as he performs Minnie Riperton\\'s 1975 hit Lovin\\' You on the piano for Carla, and forces Reggie to perform her signature high-pitched squeal. He announces \"Reggie has left the building! Thank you and good night!\" before throwing him into the piano.<br/><br/>Buddy returns to Carla, who is delighted with him. He gives a waiter a credit card to pay for the meal. Buddy and Carla then share a kiss. Immediately after, the serum begins to wear off and Buddy makes a quick exit, attributing it to an allergic reaction to Carla\\'s lipstick (the \\'bulking up\\' beginning with his lower lip, and his midsection begins to swell up). Jason happens to be at the bar and notes that the card Buddy is using belongs to Sherman. He follows Buddy into the sports car to confront him, only to learn Sherman\\'s secret when he discovers him in mid-transformation, culminating in Sherman\\'s having to be cut out of the car when he becomes too big to use the door.<br/><br/>The next morning, Sherman is very late for a class and his students have all left. The Dean, however, is there and he confronts Sherman about the sports car, which Buddy bought on Sherman\\'s faculty account. The Dean threatens to strangle Sherman and \\'cut off your air supply until you pass away\\' if he screws up again and asks him to meet Hartley at a hotel restaurant called The Ritz to describe the weight-loss serum.<br/><br/>Later, in the lab, Jason tells Sherman that he can\\'t control Buddy, whose testosterone levels keep rising per transformation, as Buddy acted the exact opposite of who Sherman, and Buddy is now becoming an independent personality instead of a thin Sherman. He warns him not to use the serum again and to focus instead on the research for Hartley. Later, Carla talks to Sherman about her date with Buddy and Sherman takes the opportunity to ask Carla to dinner with his family, who promptly embarrass him by making various suggestive comments about their relationship, his grandmother especially pushing the question on whether or not they\\'re having relations, and that there\\'s nothing wrong to admitting if they are, calling it a beautiful thing. Cletus farts again. His confidence low and, after Carla mentions that she would like the opportunity to get to know the caring person she sometimes sees in Buddy\\'s eyes, he uses the serum again. Jason tries to stop Buddy, but to no avail. Sherman seemingly tries to communicate to Jason from deep down inside Buddy and instructs Jason to go into the storage closet to get an antidote, but it turns out to be a trick by Buddy who locks Jason in before departing.<br/><br/>Buddy, who is becoming ever more aggressive, takes Carla out on a second date - this time to the hotel where Sherman was to meet Hartley. The Dean, looking for Sherman, asks Carla if she knows where Sherman is, but Carla asks Buddy if he could take Sherman\\'s place. With the Dean desperate to get the grant, he allows Buddy to talk to Hartley, but with Buddy subsequently taking all the credit for the work, much to Carla\\'s shock and outrage. Hartley and the Dean are both impressed, the Dean later asking if Buddy would be willing to fill in for Sherman on a more permanent basis and performing a final demonstration for Hartley at the alumni ball the following night.<br/><br/>Buddy then picks up three beautiful women at the hotel to take back with him. Carla finds out, and attempts to leave Buddy. Buddy then invites Carla to join them in some \"group activity,\" which only turns her away even more, calling him a \"sick, twisted freak.\" Undaunted, he throws a loud party at Sherman\\'s house that night, burning all the health food products in the fridge. Having transformed back to his normal self during the night, Sherman awakens to find himself surrounded by strange women. He has no memory of the previous night and is stunned to find the whole house in disarray.<br/><br/>Carla arrives shortly thereafter to tell Sherman that she has left Buddy and to apologize about her encouraging Buddy to talk to Hartley. One of the women from the hotel the night before comes out of Sherman\\'s room asking for Buddy and Carla thinks Sherman is as unfaithful as Buddy to the extent that the two of them actually share women. Sherman tries to explain that it\\'s not what she thinks, but she doesn\\'t listen. To add to Sherman\\'s problems as he chases after her, he finds an eviction notice taped to his front door by his unseen grouchy downstairs neighbor and landlord, Mr. Wilson, owing to all the noise Buddy and the party had made during the night. Jason then enters the scene and tells Sherman that they need to go to the lab. Trying to collect himself, Sherman tells Jason that it needs to wait until later. However, Jason stresses that there won\\'t be a later and a visit to the lab soon confirms that Dean Richmond has fired Sherman, replaced him with Buddy, given him Sherman\\'s ticket to the alumni ball, and gloatingly promises to ruin Sherman.<br/><br/>At home, depressed, Sherman accidentally activates the VCR, where Buddy has left a message taunting Sherman and encouraging him to take the serum once again. This inspires Sherman to take his life back, resolved to prove that he can defeat Buddy. He and Jason start destroying all the serum samples, but, when he sips a diet drink that Buddy has craftily filled with the serum, he transforms again. Buddy, who has \"taken on a life of his own\" with a vengeance, tells Jason that he has calculated that if he drinks 500 mL of the serum, he will have enough cellular stability to be thin forever, thus \"killing\" Sherman; however, he cannot drink all of that serum at once, as it would (literally) kill Sherman and therefore Buddy, too. Buddy, however, has a plan to drink 250 mL of the serum while still in the lab and the other 250 at the alumni ball. He then knocks Jason out and heads to the alumni ball to carry out his plan, which will simultaneously prove the validity of Sherman\\'s research.<br/><br/>Buddy arrives at the ball three hours late and starts acting rowdily to the disgrace of Dean Richmond, who scolds him for not being there on time. Buddy responds by threatening the Dean in the same way he threatened Sherman (by strangling him to death). He then begins to make his way to the stage where his plan will be put into place.<br/><br/>Back at the lab, Jason regains consciousness just in time to see a warning on the lab computer that Buddy\\'s testosterone levels are at a lethally high 60,000% and darts out of the lab to head for the ball. There, Buddy begins to demonstrate the effects of the serum to the amazed audience (which includes the Dean, Carla, Hartley, and Sherman\\'s parents), allowing himself to briefly \\'bulk up\\' just enough to demonstrate how one sip of the serum is effective enough to make him thin. Then, as he prepares to drink the second dose of serum to stay Buddy Love forever, Jason runs in and tries to stop him. Buddy punches Jason, but Jason hits back.<br/><br/>As Buddy stands poised to return a blow, Sherman starts to \"fight\" him for control of his body: fat and thin body parts beginning with his right fist and subsequently varying around the rest of his body alternate with increasing speed while Buddy\\'s voice shouts \"You can\\'t beat me!\" and Sherman\\'s voice replies \"Yes I can!\". Eventually, after a violent transformation/confrontation, Sherman wins the struggle. Still on stage, he tells the awed alumni that, while he started out wanting to help people, what he did was selfish and foolish and that he has learned that the important thing is to accept himself as he is, rather than being unhappy about how much he weighs. He leaves, but Carla stops him and asks him why he lied. He explains that he did not believe that she would accept him, and he\\'ll just have to accept the fact that he\\'ll always be fat no matter what. She proves him wrong when she asks him to dance and he agrees Jason subsequently arriving with a tuxedo that fits. The two subsequently dance for the rest of the night, much to the approval of Jason and Sherman\\'s family. Hartley then tells the Dean that he\\'s decided to give Sherman the grant, because he\\'s \"a brilliant scientist and a gentleman.\"</div></div>'}\n",

The tour guide Garrett (Zach Woods) tells the group of Gertrude Aldridge, a disturbed woman that was kept locked in the basement by her father. A candlestick falls over on the table near the basement to creep the group out, but it\\'s just part of a trick Garrett played. What he doesn\\'t see is a device beneath the nightstand that is flickering and vibrating.<br/><br/>As he is closing up shop, Garrett hears a noise near the basement. The door begins shaking, and he runs for it. Garrett tries to run out of the mansion, but the doorknob has been heated. He tries to break out a window with a stool, only for the stool to be thrown back. Garrett runs back toward the basement. The floor is filling up with green slime, and the stairs break apart. Garrett holds on as he sees a ghost rise up from the floor.<br/><br/>At Columbia University, Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) is approached by Ed Mulgrave (Ed Begley, Jr.), a publisher who has a book that Erin wrote some years ago on the existence of ghosts. She\\'s not proud of having written it, and she\\'s even less than pleased to learn it has resurfaced. Erin knows it was done by her former friend and colleague Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy). Ed approaches Erin because of the haunting at the Aldridge mansion and asks her to look in on it. As Erin looks up Abby\\'s current workplace, she learns from the university\\'s dean Harold Filmore (Charles Dance) that she is up for tenure, so she does what she can to hide knowledge of the book.<br/><br/>Erin finds Abby in her lab with her new work partner Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), a brilliant engineer who is also a bit nutty. Erin and Abby are still upset with each other over the book, and Erin demands Abby take the book off Amazon. Erin then brings up the Aldridge mansion haunting, inspiring Abby and Holtzmann to spring into action, with Erin reluctantly joining them.<br/><br/>The three ladies arrive at the mansion with some equipment. The basement has been locked tight. Erin steps on some slime. Suddenly, the three notice that the basement door is now open and emitting an eerie blue glow. They are then face-to-face with the ghost of Gertrude Aldridge. Erin approaches her calmly, but Gertrude\\'s face turns demonic and she spews ectoplasmic bile all over Erin. The ghost flies out of the building. The ladies record a video with Erin proclaiming that ghosts are real. Unfortunately, this falls into Filmore\\'s hands, and he fires Erin for being a bad representation of the school.<br/><br/>Now that Erin is jobless, she decides to join Abby and Holtzmann in their research. Abby and Holtzmann also lose their job after talking to the dean (who happens to be a dick), so they steal equipment from the school\\'s lab and decide to open up their own facility.<br/><br/>We meet MTA worker Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones). She is approached by a weird guy named Rowan North (Neil Casey). He rambles on about a \"fourth cataclysm\", which Patty pays no mind to. She then has to go into the tunnel to check something out. Behind her, Rowan plants another device similar to the one at the mansion. Patty then sees a ghost in a prison suit. She runs like hell away from it.<br/><br/>Erin, Abby, and Holtzmann set up shop in a new location above a Chinese food restaurant as the \"Department of Metaphysical Examination\". A young man named Kevin Beckman (Chris Hemsworth) shows up for a receptionist job. Erin thinks he\\'s hot, but during the interview, Kevin proves to be really dumb. Still, they hire him on the spot. The ladies are then visited by Patty, who mentions the ghost she spotted in the subway.<br/><br/>Patty leads the ladies to the tunnel where she spotted the ghost. Holtzmann brings along some equipment she built to catch the ghost. They see the same ghost that Patty saw hovering above them. They record the ghost with their HD cams while Erin is given a proton laser to capture it. The laser isn\\'t strong enough to hold the ghost down, and the train is coming in fast. The ladies run to safety as the train hits the ghost, causing them to get splattered with ectoplasm slime while the ghost is stuck on the train.<br/><br/>The video of the ghost goes viral, and the media dubs the team \"Ghostbusters\", to their chagrin. Famed de-bunker Martin Heiss (Bill Murray) goes on record to dismiss the subway ghost as fake. Patty decides to join the team since she knows how to get around the city, and she provides the team with a vehicle for carrying equipment. It\\'s a hearse that she borrowed from her uncle, which only Holtzmann seems to enjoy, and it becomes the new Ecto-1.<br/><br/>Hotlzmann shows off some new equipment she made to catch ghosts, including a new laser gun, a grenade, and a proton glove. It\\'s all untested, so most of it turns out to be dangerous, but the team thinks it\\'s all cool.<br/><br/>The team is called to investigate a ghostly sighting at a musical theater. Rowan is seen planting another device in the theater. Abby\\'s specter detector (not the actual name of the device) goes off near the dressing rooms. Patty is chased by a mannequin possessed by a ghost. The Ghostbusters hit the mannequin with their proton lasers, releasing a huge flying ghost monster into the theater. They follow it up to the stage where a band called Beasts of Mayhem are performing. The ghost flies out, making everyone think it\\'s part of the show until the Ghostbusters rush the stage and try to hit it with their lasers. Abby stage-dives and goes for it, and Patty follows, but nobody catches her. She gets up and has the ghost perched on her shoulders. The other three wait for Patty to be still as they hit it with their lasers. Holtzmann pulls out a trap and has the ghost sucked into it. Everyone cheers the team on, while Ozzy Osbourne is backstage and thinks he\\'s having a \"flashback\".<br/><br/>The team celebrates their first capture with some pizza. Abby and Erin discuss how they were friends since high school. Erin also mentions how when she was a child, the ghost of her mean neighbor would stand at the foot of her bed every day for a year, and nobody believed her when she said it. They are then visited by Martin Heiss so he can prove that the team is faking their capture. Erin gets annoyed and decides to prove Heiss right by bringing out the trap and releasing the ghost. The ghost flies out and pushes Heiss out a window as it escapes into the city.<br/><br/>After the police arrive, the team is escorted by Agents Hawkins (Michael Kenneth Williams) and Rourke (Matt Walsh) to meet with Mayor Bradley (Andy Garcia) and his assistant Jennifer Lynch (Cecily Strong). While they are thankful for the team\\'s capture of the ghost, they want them to say they are frauds so as to not cause a stir in the city.<br/><br/>When the team is alerted to a new ghost sighting, Erin realizes there is a pattern to all the appearances in the city. It is discovered that all the devices found are along leylines that intersect at the Mercado Hotel. They find a picture of the staff, and Patty recognizes Rowan among them, knowing he is their guy. The team heads to the hotel and finds Rowan in the basement with a device he built in which he plans to release a horde of ghosts upon the city as payback for being constantly mistreated. Abby tries to convince Rowan to stop his plans until she mentions the police are on their way. Rowan then grabs two pillars and electrocutes himself before the police arrive. The basement is then closed off, but the specter detector is left behind and goes haywire.<br/><br/>At home, Erin reads through a copy of her book that Rowan was keeping to orchestrate his plan. She looks through the drawings and sees that he had always planned to electrocute himself so that he can become a ghost and eventually bring about the Fourth Cataclysm to lead the ghosts and terrorize the world.<br/><br/>At headquarters, Abby hears a knocking at the door, but no one is there. There is a rattling on the sink\\'s pipe, and she sees a green glow in the drain. Rowan\\'s ghost then possesses Abby. She starts breaking Holtzmann\\'s equipment and then grabs Holtzmann by the throat to dangle her out a window. Patty intervenes and rescues Holtzmann before smacking Rowan out of Abby. Moments later, Kevin pulls up on his motorcycle, and Rowan possesses him. He rides off back to the hotel.<br/><br/>Erin runs to a restaurant where she finds Mayor Bradley and Lynch eating. She frantically tries to warn them to evacuate the city, but she comes off as crazy, so she is taken away.<br/><br/>Rowan in Kevin\\'s body makes it to the hotel basement and attacks the two guards standing outside. He manages to break the barriers keeping the ghosts trapped to allow them to fly free, beginning the ghost invasion upon the city. A portal opens in the sky, releasing more and more ghosts upon the city. Erin tries to get a cab, but the cabbie (Dan Aykroyd) dismisses her and drives off.<br/><br/>Abby, Holtzmann, and Patty gear up and head off the fight ghosts. They run into none other than Slimer (Adam Ray) the green ghost eating from a hot dog cart. He steals the Ecto-1 and drives off. Abby and Patty get ready to shoot at the car, but Holtzmann says the equipment on top of the car is basically a nuke. They then spot a bunch of ghosts that look like giant parade floats, which they start popping with their proton packs. A float in the shape of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man shows up and presses down on the three, rendering them immobile. Erin saves them by popping Stay-Puft with a Swiss army knife that Holtzmann gave her. The team then faces off against dozens of ghosts, including Gertrude, the subway ghost, and the theater ghost.<br/><br/>The Ghostbusters head to the hotel to find a still-possessed Kevin having frozen the police and military. Rowan leaves Kevin\\'s body and decides to take on a familiar, more \"friendly\" form - the Ghostbusters logo. However, he grows into a humongous beast that bursts out of the hotel and begins wreaking havoc on the city. As they see Slimer and other ghosts riding down the street, the team gets the idea to hit the Ecto-1\\'s nuclear reactor into the portal to reverse it and eventually close it. They fire their lasers at the ghosts to have them steer into the portal before hitting the reactor. The plan works, and the ghosts start getting pulled back into the portal. Rowan holds on to two buildings, so the team hits him in the groin with their lasers to loosen his grip. He starts to get sucked in, but he grabs Abby and pulls her into the portal. Erin hooks herself up to a wire and jumps into the portal. She fires her laser at Rowan\\'s hand to release Abby while he is pulled into the abyss. Holtzmann and Patty pull the two out, and they return with totally beached white hair.<br/><br/>Afterward, Mayor Bradley continues to deny the ghost problem, but he secretly gives the team funding to continue their work. They upgrade their headquarters to a firehouse (same as the original movie). Patty\\'s uncle Bill (Ernie Hudson) then pulls in with a new hearse. He\\'s not happy about what happened to the other one.<br/><br/>During the credits, we see the team being visited by Holtzmann\\'s mentor Rebecca Gorin (Sigourney Weaver), who inspired her to be crazy. Patty then calls the team to the roof. The city\\'s buildings are lit up to say \"I Love GB\". There is also a dedication to Harold Ramis.<br/><br/>After the credits, the team is doing some work while Patty is listening to a recording. Erin walks over to see what\\'s up. Patty simply asks, \"What\\'s Zuul?\"</div></div>'}\n",

Growing up, Rodney becomes infatuated by famous robotics inventor Big Weld, and decides that he wants to be an inventor and work for Big Weld industries one day.<br/><br/>Rodney spends his youth and teenage years trying to perfect his own helper robot. He attempts to show his Dad that the robot can help him wash dishes, but helper ends up causing more damage than help.<br/><br/>Determined to make something of himself and pay off the damages the helper bot caused, Rodney decides to head to Robot City to fulfill his dream and work for Big Weld Industries.<br/><br/>Upon reaching Robot City, Rodney finds the gates to Big Weld Industries shut, with no new ideas coming in. The company, now led by a robot named Ratchet, has also scrapped the business model of supplying spare parts for older robot models, and going with pricier upgrades for robots, with a new slogan titled, \"Why be you, when you can be new.\"<br/><br/>After being kicked out of Big Weld Industries, Rodney finds himself in a darker side of town, where a strange robot named Fender attempts to make off with his foot. Rodney chases after him, and finds a small collective of older robots scrounging for spare parts. In the ensuing chaos, Fender loses a part for his neck, and when the group goes to find a replacement part, finds this item has been discontinued. Even though Fender attempted to cannibalize him, Rodney helps Fender and manages to make a suitable neck replacement out of additional spare parts.<br/><br/>Fender\\'s sister, Piper, explains that many robots in Robot City are in desperate need of spare parts that Big Weld Industries used to make. However, in recent months, Big Weld has disappeared; the streets are now patrolled by motorized vehicles, known as Sweepers, that take obsolete models to a dark side of town known as the Chop Shop, run by Madam Gasket (Ratchet\\'s mother). Any collected models never come back.<br/><br/>Rodney bunks with the group and another robot named Aunt Fanny, but is surprised the next day when the local parts shop closes its doors, claiming that all spare parts orders from Big Weld Industries have officially dried up. All sorts of robot citizens are up in arms, but Rodney comes forward, and using what spare parts are left, helps those less fortunate.<br/><br/>Soon, the parts loss is felt at home, as Rodney receives a letter from his parents, saying that without spare parts, his father will not survive. Word soon reaches Rodney about an annual company ball held by Big Weld Industries. Rodney and Fender break into the festivities in hopes to talk to Big Weld and convince him to help, since Big Weld always attends this function.<br/><br/>However, Ratchet appears claiming that Big Weld couldn\\'t attend. Rodney then comes forward, demanding to know where Big Weld is, and brings to the company\\'s attention the plight of the average bot, of whom Rodney has spent several days trying to repair countless numbers of.<br/><br/>Ratchet orders Rodney be captured, but he, Fender, and a female employee named Cappy manage to escape the party. Fender parts ways with the group, while Rodney and Cappy head to Big Weld\\'s mansion to investigate. Rodney is at first excited to meet his childhood hero, but soon grows disillusioned when Big Weld tells him to give up his fight to fix the outmoded robots. Big Weld claims that in the face of change for Big Weld Industries, Ratchet took over, turning the company into an entity that was more about profits than helping others.<br/><br/>Rodney then heads to the train station intent on going home, when the other robots and Fender appear. Fender, having just survived almost being destroyed in the Chop Shop, has overheard of the Sweepers being deployed in full force the next day by Madame Gasket and Ratchet to collect all the outmoded robots in Robot City.<br/><br/>Big Weld also shows up, and inspires the group not to give up; they all return to Big Weld Industries to confront Ratchet; Big Weld (inspired by the bots still believing in him) fires Ratchet, who weeps and begs for another chance; caught off-guard, Big Weld succumbs to a knockout punch from Ratchet, who then realizes he\\'s become as crazy as his own mother!<br/><br/>Security arrives to remove Big Weld just as Rodney and Cappy turn up; between them they help Big Weld escape the building and end up being chased across Robot City, eventually ending up outside Madam Gasket\\'s Chop Shop (although Big Weld goes shooting through the gates to the inside).<br/><br/>The group all tool up and enter the Chop Shop to rescue Big Weld from a certain melting down, but are faced with Madam Gasket, Ratchet and the army of new-fangled Sweepers.

Madam Gasket gets melted down and Ratchet gets strung up in chains (next to his poor hen-pecked father) simultaneously losing his flashy upgrades!

Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) blasts away foes as he calls in assistance from B-127 (voice of Dylan O\\'Brien). The small Autobot comes in beating the Decepticons until Optimus tasks him with a mission. They head toward a launch pad so that Optimus can send B-127 to planet Earth for refuge and to help establish a base for the Autobots. The Decepticons rush over to destroy the launch pad, but B-127 makes it off Cybertron in time while Optimus stays to keep fighting.<br/><br/>The year is 1987 in the California town of Brighton Falls. Charleen \\'Charlie\\' Watson (Hailee Steinfeld) wakes up and goes to meet her family; her mother Sally (Pamela Adlon), brother Otis (Jason Drucker), and stepfather Ron (Stephen Schneider). Charlie hasn\\'t gotten over the passing of her father and has not fully accepted Ron as part of the family. She then goes to work at a carnival where her co-worker Memo (Jorge Lindeborg, Jr.) tries to get her attention because he has a crush on her, but she just ignores him. Charlie then accidentally spills lemonade on a guy from school and is mocked by the popular girls led by Tina (Gracie Dzienny). Later at home, Charlie tries to fix up a car that she had been working on with her father, but she becomes discouraged and feels that she can\\'t do it on her own.<br/><br/>We cut to a training exercise involving paint balls between Sector 7 agents. Agent Jack Burns (John Cena) boasts his win to his peers, just moments before they see B-127 come crashing down to the ground. As he rises to his feet, the agents go after the Autobot and chase him until he\\'s cornered. B-127 speaks and says he doesn\\'t want to hurt the agents. However, a real threat arrives in the form of Blitzwing (voice of David Sobolov), who fires upon the agents before chasing after B-127. Blitzwing catches him and demands that he give up the whereabouts of Optimus and the other Autobots. B-127 says he\\'ll never talk, so Blitzwing makes it official by ripping out his voice box and then dropping him down the side of a cliff. He then tries to kill B-127, but the little guy manages to throw a grenade at Blitzwing and use his blaster to obliterate the Decepticon. B-127 grows weaker as his systems start to shut down and his memory core starts failing. He then scans a Volkswagen Beetle before shutting down.<br/><br/>Charlie goes by her Uncle Hank\\'s (Len Cariou) garage to help out, when she spots a yellow Beetle. Since it\\'s her birthday, she asks for the car. When Hank won\\'t budge, Charlie offers to work at the garage for a year, but Hanks relents and lets her take it home. Charlie drives the car home and hides it from her mom in the garage. She notices something fall from her the car, so she looks underneath and sees B-127\\'s face. He reacts quick and takes on his Autobot form. Charlie lets him know she is not going to hurt him, and he appears to trust her. Since he can\\'t talk anymore, he makes a buzzing sound, which Charlie says sounds like a bumblebee, so she decides that his name will now be Bumblebee. However, Charlie activating Bumblebee also causes a signal to go out across the galaxy. Two Decepticons, Shatter (voice of Angela Bassett) and Dropkick (voice of Justin Theroux), are interrogating the Autobot Cliffjumper (voice of Andrew Morgado) on Optimus\\'s whereabouts until they get a read on Bee\\'s signal. Dropkick slices Cliffjumper down the middle as he follows Shatter to Earth.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, a redneck couple, Roy (Lenny Jacobson) and Amber (Megyn Price), argue because Roy spent the rent money on a new car. They look up in the sky to see a falling object, and Roy tries to protect his car, but the object hits a truck. A second falling object comes down and not only destroys Roy\\'s car, but the gas station behind it. Shatter and Dropkick then emerge from the craters and stand before the couple. Dropkick liquidates Roy before the two head off on their mission.<br/><br/>In the morning, Charlie goes to the garage to greet Bumblebee, but finds that he\\'s gone. She freaks out and asks Otis if someone took the car, and he says that Sally took it to take their dog Conan to the vet. Charlie rides her bike and chases after her mom as Bumblebee sticks his arm out, and she orders him to stop. Charlie manages to stop Sally and makes up an excuse so that she can drive the car.<br/><br/>At Sector 7 HQ, a young Agent Simmons (Nick Pilla) brings information to Burns on energy readings that just came in. Burns leads other agents, plus Dr. Powell (John Ortiz), to a site where they meet Shatter and Dropkick. Shatter tells the agents that they are there for Bumblebee, claiming he is a fugitive and that he must be captured. Against Burns\\'s better judgment, the agents agree to help the Decepticons track Bumblebee down.<br/><br/>Charlie takes Bee to the beach so that she can let him know that he has to maintain his disguise around anybody who isn\\'t her. She takes him into the woods to try and fix something inside him, and she ends up activating a message from Optimus, which is to remind Bee to aid in bringing the Autobots to Earth, as well of the ongoing Cybertronian civil war. It triggers a flashback in Bee for when he was escaping Cybertron as he watched Optimus fight off Shockwave, Soundwave, and Ravage.<br/><br/>Charlie brings Bee home so that she can help him communicate through his radio. She tries a few tapes, like The Smiths and Rick Astley, but Bee rejects them. Outside, Memo tries to knock on Charlie\\'s door to finally talk to her, but he ends up seeing Bumblebee as an Autobot, and it doesn\\'t help when he transforms into a Volkswagon car right in front of him. Charlie tells Memo not to freak out, and she makes him promise to keep this knowledge between the two of them.<br/><br/>The Sector 7 agents allow Shatter and Dropkick to access their technology and create a connected web of information with their own advanced gear. Burns rightfully doesn\\'t trust the Decepticons, and his commanding officer allows him to do what he wants with the bots once they have found and captured Bumblebee.<br/><br/>Charlie goes ahead to work on the other car while Bee watches \"The Breakfast Club\" and becomes amused by the famous fist pump shot. He goes for another tape, but he grabs a tape labled \"Charlie\\'s Dive Meet\". Charlie gets upset and turns it off because that was the last time she saw her father, as he was the one recording it. She tells Bee that he died of a heart attack and that she never got to say goodbye, and she thinks that fixing the car will be like preserving a piece of him, but she can\\'t fix it and feels helpless. Charlie breaks down as Bee comforts her.<br/><br/>Later on, Memo joins Charlie and Bee as they head out for the day. They go by a cliff-side where Charlie\\'s classmates are hanging out. The guy who she spilled lemonade on recognizes her, but instead for knowing her as a diver. He challenges Charlie to jump off the cliff and into the water, but as Charlie gets ready to do so, she backs out, as she is reminded too much of her father. Tina goes to her car to taunt her and cruelly bring up Charlie\\'s father. Memo then proposes they get revenge. Later that night, they go by Tina\\'s house to throw toilet paper all over it. They show Bee how to get in on it, but he just throws all the rolls over the house. They then get some eggs to pelt Tina\\'s car with. Bee manages to throw all the eggs onto the car, but he gets carried away and then proceeds to stomp on Tina\\'s car and completely wreck it. Charlie and Memo hop inside Bee before Tina comes outside to see that her car is now a pancake.<br/><br/>While Charlie is at work, Bee follows Conan through the doggy door. He ends up inside the house, making a huge mess of things before sticking his finger in an electrical socket, which causes a shortage that blows up the transformers outside. This also sends out an Energon signal that Shatter and Dropkick pick up, which alerts the Sector 7 agents to Bee\\'s whereabouts. Memo sees the chaos outside and calls Charlie, urging her to come home. She does so and sees the mess that Bee made, and she scolds him, scaring him but apologizes. Sally later comes home to find the place a mess and she begins to chastise Charlie for whatever happened, thinking she is acting out. Charlie hits back that she hasn\\'t been able to find happiness and move on since her dad died unlike Sally.<br/><br/>Charlie leaves with Bee and Memo. They are discovered by the agents and are promptly pursued. Bee tries to protect Charlie, but he gets tased, and so does she. Bee is taken into Sector 7, leading Charlie and Memo to go rescue him. Shatter and Dropkick pick at Bee\\'s body until they find the message from Optimus. Once they realize that the Autobots are coming to Earth, they decide to contact the other Decepticons to also come to the planet so they can kill their enemies, along with the humans. Dr. Powell overhears them and tries to warn Burns, just before Dropkick liquidates Powell as well. The Decepticons appear to kill Bumblebee as well before they head off to make contact. Charlie and Memo run to Bee and grab electric guns to try and give him electricity to bring him back. It appears to not work at first, but Bee rises up and Charlie hugs him. The electric shocks also bring back all of Bee\\'s memories.<br/><br/>The three step outside, only to be confronted by the agents. Burns orders them to fire on Bee to restrain him. When he sees that Charlie is in danger, Bee musters up his strength to fight back against the agents. He ends up becoming fueled with rage as he fires back on the agents, severely injuring them until Charlie tells Bee to stop because she knows he is not a killer. Bee backs down and takes Charlie with him to go stop the Decepticons. Memo tries to join her, but she tells him to stay behind, and she leaves him with a kiss on the cheek.<br/><br/>Otis is forced to tell Sally where Charlie is, so she has Ron drive out to find her. They end up in a chase alongside Bee and Charlie as they are pursued by more agents. Bee and Charlie manage to get away while Ron narrowly avoids crashing and getting struck by the other oncoming cars. Otis finds the whole near-death experience awesome until he pukes.<br/><br/>Shatter and Dropkick prepare to use a device on a tower to send out a call to the Decepticons. Charlie heads up the tower to remove the device while Bee fights Dropkick. The Decepticon uses his weaponry against Bee, but the Autobot grabs a chain and wraps it around Dropkick. With one swift pull, Bee tears Dropkick to pieces. Shatter then tries to kill Charlie, but Bee swoops in to save her. Burns also attempts to fly in with his helicopter during the chaos, but is attacked by Shatter. Before he crashes, Bee catches and saves Burns. He continues to fight Shatter as Charlie pulls off the device from the tower. Just when it looks like Shatter has the upper hand, Bee fires a blast that breaks a dam. Bee grabs Shatter and holds her as a ship crashes into them, destroying Shatter and sending Bee to the bottom of the water. Charlie dives in and helps him out. Burns finds them and allows them to leave, now having respect for Bumblebee.<br/><br/>Charlie brings Bee just outside of San Francisco to part ways, knowing that Bee\\'s fellow Autobots need him just as Charlie has people there that need her. She tearfully says goodbye to Bee, and he hugs her back. He then scans a Camaro and takes that form before he heads off. Charlie returns home where a crowd is gathered after the events that happened. She reunites with her family, hugging Sally, sincerely thanking Otis for letting his parents know where she was, and showing Ron some respect. Memo then joins her and tries to hold her hand, but she tells him they\\'re not quite there yet.<br/><br/>Optimus meets Bumblebee on Earth where he tells his leader his new name as they await the arrival of the other Autobots. Meanwhile, Charlie finally fixes up her dad\\'s car and takes it out for a spin.</div></div>'}\n",

When the locals start to disappear and even the inquisitive deputy can\\'t come up with answers, suspicions emerge that the incident was anything but an accident. As the truth finally begins emerge, no one is prepared to learn what now stalks the unsuspecting citizens of this once quiet community.</div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">The film starts in February of 1979, at a steel plant in Lillian, Ohio. Elizabeth Lamb (Caitriona Balfe) has been killed in an accident. Though their family and friends are sad for her husband, Deputy Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler), their main concern is Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), Elizabeth and Jackson\\'s son. Joe was more attached to his Mom than his Dad, who was never really been there for his son.<br/><br/>Later at the Lamb\\'s house, Louis Dainard (Ron Eldard) pays a visit. Jackson blames Louis for his wife\\'s death, and forces him out of the house and puts him in his squad car. As Joe watches his father take Louis away, his gaze shifts to a silver locket in his hand.<br/><br/>Four months later, the local Middle School lets out for the summer. Joe\\'s friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) has been shooting a Super 8 film for a film festival in Cleveland. Charles has rewritten the the story so that the detective now has a wife. Joe is unsure about this last-minute rewrite, but when Charles tells him that he has gotten Alice Dainard for the part (Elle Fanning), he becomes less-concerned. The two then promise to rendezvous later that night to film their scene, with plans for Alice to drive them.<br/><br/>Arriving home, Joe meets up with his Dad who takes him out for dinner. Jackson Lamb wants his son to attend a baseball camp for the summer, but Joe explains that he wants to help Charles finish his film. Both reach a impasse, having little more to say on the matter.<br/><br/>Later that evening, Joe goes to meet Charles and the rest of their crew: Cary (Ryan Lee), Preston (Zach Mills), and Martin (Gabriel Basso). When Alice shows up in her Dad\\'s Buick Skylark, she\\'s concerned that \\'the Deputy\\'s Son\\' knows she\\'s driving without a license. Joe promises not to tell, and Alice reluctantly allows him along for the ride.<br/><br/>The group arrives at the Lillian Train Station, where Charles intends to shoot a scene with Martin as the detective of his story, trying to get his wife (aka Alice) to leave because of a zombie infection.\\nJoe is smitten with Alice, who shocks the guys when during the rehearsal, she delivers a performance that brings her to tears. The boys are snapped out of their shock by the sound of an approaching train. Charles demands they start filming again ASAP so they can put the train into their film and increase the \\'production value.\\'<br/><br/>As they film the scene of the train thundering past the station, Joe catches sight of a white truck turning onto the tracks. The truck hits the train, causing a massive (and explosive) derailment. The gang runs for cover, and luckily survive the ordeal. Joe hears something pounding loudly on one of the derailed train cars right before the door flies off.<br/><br/>Surveying the wreckage, they come across some strange white cubes (Joe takes one), and find the wreckage of the truck. Inside, they find the body of one of their local science teacher, Dr Woodward (Glynn Turman). Joe removes a map from the doctor\\'s hand. Everyone is shocked when he starts talking to them. Pulling a gun, he threatens them and tells them that they are not to tell anyone what they saw.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the sound of men approaching the wreck catches their attention. Fearful of being caught, they recover Charles\\' Super 8 camera, and quickly drive off. In the car, everyone is panicked about what just happened, and Alice says her coming was a mistake.<br/><br/>Analysis of the camera the next day reveals that it the lens is broken; however, Charles and Joe drop off the film for development. Joe insists he will help Charles finish the film, offering his Dad\\'s video camera. However, Charles believes that Alice will most likely not want to help them after the night before.<br/><br/>Joe goes over to Alice\\'s house to convince her to help them finish the film. Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Alice\\'s father (Ron Eldard). He demands that Joe stay away from the family\\'s home and Alice. Seeing that her father is somewhat drunk, she agrees to help Joe and his friends.<br/><br/>The gang then goes out to the scene of the train-crash, this time using it as background for their filming. During the filming, Joe notices that the train features Air Force insignia. Later at a restaurant, he peruses the map that Dr. Woodward had in his possession, noting a red line drawn in, snaking across the country. The group is still unsure why Woodward did what he did, but some are of the persuasion it was a failed suicide attempt.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jackson Lamb has come to the train-wreck site looking for answers. However, none of the clean-up crew or their superior, General Nelec (Noah Emmerich), are willing to tell him anything, other than the cargo and clean-up is not hazardous. Jackson notes the government men picking up strange little white cubes, and making plaster casts of some tire tracks in the ground.<br/><br/>The next day, the town devolves into a state of crisis, as Sheriff Pruitt (Brett Rice) goes missing. His wrecked vehicle is found near a gas station, with its windows smashed in and the attendant also missing. Jackson also receives reports of missing people, dogs and electrical equipment. While some report missing household items like microwaves, the oddest thing are missing electrical lines and engines straight out of vehicles.<br/><br/>Jackson soon grows concerned when the Military begins to roll into Lillian. Still not receiving answers as to their presence in the town, he receives word from one of the townspeople about a radio frequency that seems to be picking up Military transmissions. Jackson has the other officers tune their radios into the frequency, and soon hears word of something codenamed \"Operation: Walking Distance.\"<br/><br/>Shortly after hearing the transmission, Jackson encounters Alice\\'s father Louis, who tells Jackson to keep Joe away from Alice. Upset at hearing this, Jackson tracks down Joe, and takes back his movie camera as well. Jackson finds the Military moving stuff out of Dr Woodward\\'s home. Finding General Nelec at the site, Jackson again demands answers. When he doesn\\'t get any, he mentions \\'Operation: Walking Distance.\\' This causes Nelec to agree to meet with Jackson later on that evening at a nearby airfield.<br/><br/>Taking him home, Jackson demands that Joe keep away from the Dainards, but Joe claims that Alice isn\\'t like her father, and that she\\'s nice. The two once again reach a wordless impasse, before Jackson storms out of the house. He then goes to the airfield to meet with General Nelec, only to be placed under arrest and locked away.<br/><br/>Joe heads over to the cemetery after this, where he sits at the headstone of his Mother\\'s grave. While there, he hears some loud scraping and noises coming from a garage near the tombstones. Returning to his room later on, he is surprised when Alice appears. As they sit and talk, Alice asks Joe about the locket she\\'s seen him carrying around. He claims it belonged to his Mother, and they retrieved it after her accident. Alice also finds Joe has a projector set up, and sees he has been watching home movies of his Mom from when he was younger. Alice tells Joe that she is sorry for the pain her Dad caused, and feels he really is not all bad. Joe tells that he also does not feel any ill will towards her Dad, when their attention is drawn to the strange white cube Joe picked up at the crash site. As they watch, it begins to vibrate, before shooting through a nearby wall, leaving a hole behind.<br/><br/>Alice then heads home, only to find her father drunk and smoking in their living room. Disgusted by her father\\'s behavior, she rushes out and gets on her bike. Louis drunkenly follows in his car, but ends up crashing it. As Alice is unsure what to do, a she turns to see a large creature that causes her to scream. Louis attempts to get free of his wrecked car, but finds Alice and the creature gone.<br/><br/>The next day, Joe and Charles go to pick up the developed Super 8 film, but Charles is rather upset and cryptic towards Joe. When they finally get to Joe\\'s place and watch the film, Charles explains that he is upset that Joe and Alice seem to be getting along and liking each other. The reason Charles cast Alice in the film, was because HE actually liked her. As they examine the film, their thoughts become turned when they see parts of a strange creature emerging from one of the wrecked train cars. As they wonder what it was they just saw, air raid sirens begin to go off.<br/><br/>They emerge outside to find the town being evacuated, with everyone being asked to report to the local Military base. Word is that a dangerous fire is headed towards Lillian, and could cause terrible damage if it reaches the town\\'s chemical plant. Joe and Charles get on a bus, and are transported to the base. There, Charles is reunited with his family, while Joe goes to look for his Dad. However, he instead finds Louis, who tells Joe that he saw Alice being taken away by a creature, but nobody believes him.<br/><br/>Joe then rounds up Charles and their friends, with the intent to get back into town and rescue Alice. Bribing the town\\'s camera-store owner to help them, he manages to get them into town. They first go to the Middle School. Dr Woodward had a specially padlocked storage area behind the school where he hid confiscated items from his class. Joe assumes that there may be additional information relating to his past, and the group finds numerous films, tapes, and records stored in there as well, that could help them find out more about the creature and how to possibly defeat it.<br/><br/>Breaking into the school, they use a film projector in one of the classrooms. Through the materials, they learn that the creature is subterranean, and mainly wants to just go home. However, General Nelec was more intent on keeping the creature for Army purposes. They also found its ship contained technology that when disassembled, \\'shattered\\' into the little white cubes that the group saw at the crash site. Due to Woodward\\'s interactions with the creature, he was able to gain a telepathic link to it, and notes in his findings that due to the hostilities directed towards it, it has grown hostile in nature to humans as well. The boys soon hear noises in the school, and are soon found by Nelec and his men. The group confiscates the items, as well as Joe\\'s Mom\\'s locket.<br/><br/>The boys are put on a Military bus and are headed back to the base when the creature attacks the bus. The boys manage to escape while the creature attacks the other Military Officers and kills General Nelec. In the aftermath, Joe is able to obtain his Mom\\'s locket.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jackson has managed to escape his captors, and after creating a diversion, gets to the other base where the townspeople are being kept. He finds one of Joe\\'s friends there, and after hearing of Joe\\'s plans to rescue Alice, finds her father and takes him along. On their journey to the town, Louis explains that he came to the Lamb\\'s house after the funeral to apologize. Jackson also admits that he knows that Louis is sorry, and quietly forgives him.<br/><br/>The boys meanwhile, have made it back into town, but suddenly find themselves in the middle of a war zone, as tanks and other Military weaponry are going haywire, firing random shots and destroying property. As the boys attempt to escape, Martin is injured. Charles stays behind to tend to his wounds, as Joe and Cary rush off to the cemetery.<br/><br/>Joe tells Cary about the strange things he saw and heard from the garage. Breaking down a door, they find a large hole, dug down several stories deep. Climbing down, they see it leads up to several other places. Eventually, they come across the creature\\'s lair under the town\\'s water tower, which houses all sorts of mechanical parts, including the missing items from the townspeople. As they watch, they see several people strung from the ceiling, including the missing Sheriff, as well as Alice. Before they can rescue her, they catch a glimpse of the creature, who is eating the limb of another human!<br/><br/>Fearful that Alice might be next, Joe directs Cary to create a distraction using the fireworks in his backpack. This causes the distraction that Joe needs as the creature heads down the tunnel towards the loud sounds. Joe manages to save Alice, as well as the Sheriff and a woman with rollers in her hair. As they rush to find a way out, they encounter Cary, who thought he was heading towards an exit. Suddenly, the creature comes up behind them, snatching the Sheriff and the other woman into the darkness.<br/><br/>Joe, Alice, and Cary run but are soon at a dead end. The creature has them cornered, but Joe stands before it, reasoning with it. The creature acts hostile at first, but even in the face of its bizarre appearance, Joe does not react hostilely like the previous treatment it has known. Suddenly, a sound is heard deep in the cave near the creature\\'s lair, and it puts Joe down before returning.<br/><br/>The three return to the surface and congregate near the water tower. As they do, all sorts of mechanical objects in the area become magnetized to the water tower\\'s top area. Truck trailers nearby that also contained the recovered white cubes burst open, and the cubes begin to form around the edges of the water tower as well.<br/><br/>During the spectacle, Jackson and Louis come across their children, and both families reconcile as the creature ascends the water tower. As they watch, the locket in Joe\\'s pocket attempts to fly away. Joe catches it, and we see what was inside it the whole time: a picture of Joe\\'s Mom and him as a baby. Joe finally \\'lets go\\' of his Mom, and the locket flies up to the magnetized water tower, where the metallic objects and the white cubes morph into a spaceship. The creature climbs aboard, as the top of the water tower disappears, raining down its watery contents on the people below.<br/><br/>Everyone watches as the ship ascends into the sky. As they do, Joe and Alice hold each other\\'s hands. They and their families have reconciled over their past differences, but who knows what the future will bring?<br/><br/>-Extras over the Film Credits*<br/><br/>Over the film\\'s credits, we see that Charles has completed his movie, titled \\'The Case.\\' The Super 8 film consists of a detective investigating a rash of zombie appearances that seem linked to a company called \\'Romero Chemicals.\\' The head of the company denies any wrong-doing, but the detective feels something is amiss. He attempts to send his wife away to keep her safe, but she refuses. While at the train station, they witness a train derailment (the footage captured on their camera replaced by model trains from Joe\\'s collection). The detective soon encounters a doctor who has an antidote to the zombie disease, but only enough for one person. As he attempts to administer it to a captured zombie, the detective watches as the zombie bites into the doctor.<br/><br/>After killing the zombified Doctor, the detective returns home, only to find his wife has become a zombie! He stabs her in the neck with the antidote. It appears that it has not worked, and he prepares to kill his wife. However, suddenly she returns to normal, and the two embrace.<br/><br/>A final shot shows Charles in a suit and smoking a pipe, thanking the audience for watching, and considering them for the Cleveland film festival...before Alice pops into frame in her zombie make-up, \\'terrorizing\\' the camera lens.</div></div>'}\n",

Then we see a proto-human in prehistoric times drinking from a lake. Lucy (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0424060/?ref_=ttpl\">Scarlett Johansson</a>) narrates by saying that life began billions of years ago, and ponders just what we have done with it since then.<br/><br/>In the present, Lucy is a young American woman outside a hotel in Taiwan with her week-long boyfriend Richard (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm1561982/?ref_=ttpl\">Pilou Asbæk</a>). He is asking her to take a briefcase up to the room of a Mr. Jang (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0158856/?ref_=ttpl\">Choi Min-sik</a>). Even though offered $500, she refuses to do anything for Richard without knowing what it is that he wants her to deliver, so he handcuffs Lucy\\'s wrist to the handle of the briefcase, leaving her with no choice. She enters the lobby and tells the clerk that Richard is sending her up to Jang, and then nervously gives her name to the clerk. Lucy looks out the window to see Richard smiling and trying to be encouraging, until he is shot and killed. A group of thugs come out of the elevator and force Lucy to go up with them. This scene is juxtaposed with footage of a cheetah chasing a gazelle, mauling it and then carrying the gazelle\\'s corpse in its teeth.<br/><br/>They take Lucy to Jang\\'s apartment. There are bloodied corpses on the floor, causing Lucy to vomit. Jang comes out with his hands soaked in blood. He rings up a man on the phone to translate for Lucy. She cries, not knowing what is going on or why any of this is happening. Jang writes down number \\'140\\' on a piece of paper, which is the code to open the briefcase. Jang steps into the next room while his men arm themselves with guns and shields. Lucy opens the briefcase, which contains four 1 kg bags of blue powdered crystals. Jang brings in a drugged-up man to snort some of the blue powder. The man briefly convulses and then starts laughing maniacally until Jang shoots him in the head. Lucy is then ordered to do a job, which she refuses to do until she gets smacked.<br/><br/>Lucy wakes up in a hotel room. There is a bandage on her stomach. Jang\\'s men come in and throw her some clothes. She is taken to Jang, along with three other men. A British man known as \"The Limey\" (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0722279/?ref_=ttpl\">Julian Rhind-Tutt</a>) comes in to explain to Lucy that she and the other men have had a drug called CPH4 stuffed into their lower intestines. The drug is supposed to be the next big thing on the market, and they intend to smuggle it across the world. Afterwards, Lucy is taken to a room and chained up, where one of the thugs, tries to get into her jeans, then starts kicking her in the stomach, right where they cut into her. This causes a tear in the drug bag, leaking the powder into Lucy\\'s system. She begins to writhe and thrash all across the room, even reaching up to the ceiling until she falls back down to the floor.<br/><br/>As all of this happens, we meet Professor Samuel Norman (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000151/?ref_=ttpl\">Morgan Freeman</a>) giving a lecture to a classroom on his research of the brain\\'s capacity. He essentially explains what could happen if humans could exceed beyond the suggested 10% brain capacity that they use, as well as its responses to certain environments that would allow the brain to submit to immortality or reproduction. Basically, if the subject doesn\\'t like their environment, they would choose immortality and move elsewhere, but if they were happy with their setting, they would be inclined to reproduce (complete with images of every species engaging in intercourse). If, say, humans could reach up to 40%, they could manipulate matter (footage of a magic show is juxtaposed here as an example). One student asks Norman what would happen if humans reached 100%. He says he has no idea.<br/><br/>Lucy reawakens, with her eyes glowing bright blue. She sits upright, calmer than before. A thug comes into the room, and Lucy spreads her legs to tempt him. The thug smiles and lays down his gun on the table. As he walks over to her, Lucy grabs his belt and flips him over, then pulls the table over to take the gun. After she frees herself, she shoots the other thugs as they\\'re eating. She gets shot in the shoulder, but is able to dig the bullet out without feeling pain. She then eats all the thugs\\' food before leaving. She finds two taxi drivers outside, shoots one in the leg and gets one of them to take her to the hospital.<br/><br/>On her way to the hospital, Lucy has heightened senses and is able to hear peoples\\' voices from outside the car. When she gets to the hospital, she is able to clearly read the signs as if they were in English to her. She gets to an operating room where doctors are working on a man. Lucy looks at the patient\\'s X-ray scans and then shoots the man, stating to the doctors that they wouldn\\'t have been able to save him because the tumor in his brain had already spread far enough. She forces the doctors to take the bag out of her stomach. She then calls her mother to tell her that she feels everything - the air, the blood in her veins, the heat leaving her body, and is even able to access the deepest parts of her memories, like when she was sick as a child or even petting a cat when she was barely a year old. She tells her mother that she loves her before hanging up. The doctor pulls the bag of drugs out of Lucy\\'s stomach, and after she tells him that it\\'s CPH4, he tells her that this is something that pregnant women produce six weeks into their pregnancy as nutrients for the fetus, and that the doctor is surprised Lucy has survived this long with it in her body.<br/><br/>Lucy makes one more stop back to the hotel to find Jang as he is in the middle of getting a tattoo and a facial. She kills his guards and then shoos the tattoo artist away before sticking knives in both of Jang\\'s hands. With her newfound powers, she does a Vulcan mind meld into his brain and sees where the other three drug mules are going based on images of their plane tickets. She leaves, and Jang lets out a pained scream.<br/><br/>Lucy goes to the apartment of her friend Caroline (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm3006818/?ref_=ttpl\">Lio Tipton</a>) to use her laptop. She reads all of Norman\\'s research in a matter of seconds, then contacts him to tell him what she\\'s read. He is astonished to hear that she read everything, even as she continues to explain what she is feeling and experiencing, now that she has reached up to 20% brain capacity. She is able to manipulate electronics, making her appearance on the TV in Norman\\'s hotel room, as well as his phone and the radio. She plans to meet with him in 12 hours. Before leaving, she prints out a prescription for Caroline, telling her that her liver and kidneys are failing and that she needs to make new lifestyle choices and she\\'ll be okay.<br/><br/>The news about Lucy shooting the patient has spread, so as she makes her way through the airport, she changes her hair color and style. She calls a French policeman, Captain Pierre Del Rio (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0906756/?ref_=ttpl\">Amr Waked</a>), to inform him of the other drug mules. She then boards the plane and continues her research on the brain, typing on her laptop at rapid-fire pace. The flight attendants ask her to turn off her computer, and Lucy asks for a glass of champagne, while also telling one flight attendant to wipe her nose without looking, and the lady\\'s nose bleeds after. Lucy is given the champagne glass and toasts \"To knowledge.\" She sips, and then \"40%\" flashes onscreen. She discovers a tooth in her glass, and then she spits up three more teeth. Then her skin starts to disintegrate, in plain sight of the passengers and flight attendants. Lucy runs to the bathroom, where her fingers start to disappear, and her face begins to sort of melt. She pulls out the rest of the CPH4 and snorts it, restoring herself to normal, but she passes out.<br/><br/>Lucy wakes up in a hospital room, with Del Rio and a few other officers and doctors waiting, right after they have apprehended the other mules. She sits up instantly, to the alarm of a nurse. Meanwhile, one of Jang\\'s henchmen, Jii (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm5958824/?ref_=ttpl\">Nicolas Phongpheth</a>), comes in with more armed men to find the other mules. They take them into a room and cut the drugs out of them after killing them. Lucy leaves the room and is surrounded by armed men. With a wave of her fingers, she is able to put them all to sleep, except for Del Rio. Together, they find Jang\\'s men, and, with her brain function now at 60%, she moves them around the hall and prevents Jii from escaping with the briefcase full of drugs by creating a sort of invisible wall. She swipes the drugs from Jii and starts to leave, but orders Del Rio to go with her. He thinks he is of no use to her, but she walks over to him and kisses him, asking him to come \"as a reminder.\"<br/><br/>Lucy uses her powers to find a new location, taking over Del Rio\\'s car and driving manically through the streets, admitting she\\'s never driven before. Jang and Jii follow her.<br/><br/>Lucy and Del Rio find Norman and his colleagues in a university, where she begins to divulge all she has come to realize with her brain power now exceeding that of a normal human being. While this happens, Jang and his men infiltrate the place and start shooting. Lucy gives the rest of the CPH4 to the professors for them to synthesize into a liquid material that goes into her bloodstream. Her brain function goes to 70% and her hands start to turn into a black wormy sort of goo that attaches itself to the computers in the room, giving Lucy more energy from matter, and thereby supplying her with an insane amount of power. As her brain function continues to increase, she manipulates matter in such a way that she seems to erase everything in the room, leaving the professors standing in white space before creating some kind of new age super computer before their eyes. From outside, as Jang\\'s men are shot down by the police, he orders Jii to do something. Jii takes a rocket launcher and blasts through the room, sending Lucy thousands of miles to Times Square. She manages to move time with a wave of her hand. She travels backwards, from early 20th century New York, to colonial times, even all the way to prehistoric times to come face-to-face with the proto - human from the opening scene. They touch fingers, sending Lucy through the cosmos and all of space and time, giving her unlimited and infinite power.<br/><br/>Jang enters the room and slowly raises his gun to Lucy\\'s head. And then she reaches 100%. Her body disappears, leaving her clothes behind. Jang fires his gun at nothing. Del Rio comes in and shoots Jang to death. The black matter in the room disappears and morphs into a flash drive that lands in Norman\\'s hands, thus expanding and completing his research. Del Rio asks where Lucy is. A message appears on his phone saying, \"I AM EVERYWHERE.\"<br/><br/>The film concludes with an overhead shot of Jang\\'s corpse while Lucy\\'s voice says this is what can be done with life.</div></div>'}\n",

But, there, inside a mysterious, complex structure of cavernous dark chambers and an intricate underground system of tunnels, more enigmas await.

One of the aliens consumes a dark liquid, causing its body to disintegrate and fall into a nearby waterfall. We see its DNA break down and recombine, seeding the planet with the building blocks of life.<br/><br/>In the year 2089 on the Isle of Skye off the shore of Scotland, archaeologist couple Elizabeth Shaw (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0636426/?ref_=ttpl\">Noomi Rapace</a>) and her boyfriend Charlie Holloway (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm1334869/?ref_=ttpl\">Logan Marshall-Green</a>) discover a star map in a cave which they record among the remnants of several otherwise unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanity\\'s forerunners. Peter Weyland (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0001602/?ref_=ttpl\">Guy Pearce</a>), the elderly founder and CEO of the Weyland Corporation, funds the creation of the scientific deep space research vessel called the USS Prometheus to follow the map to the distant moon of LV-223 several light years from Earth.<br/><br/>The ship\\'s crew travels in hibernation stasis at light speed while the android David (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm1055413/?ref_=ttpl\">Michael Fassbender</a>) stays awake at the pilot control to monitor their entire voyage. In 2093, the ship arrives in the orbit around LV-223 (Note: it is not the same planet first seen in the 1979 movie Alien but is in a nearby region of space, as confirmed by Ridley Scott on Friday June 1st on BBC radio 5 live. Alien is set on LV-426). After being awakened from hibernation, the crew are informed of their mission to find the ancient aliens, called \"Engineers\" who may be the creators of the human race. They also view a holographic message from Weyland himself, who tells them about his funding for the mission and that he has since died. Weyland also informs everyone that Charlie and Elizabeth are in charge of the mission.<br/><br/>The Prometheus enters the atmosphere of the planet, encountering turbulence which dissipates when they break through the cloud cover and can see the surface. The Prometheus lands near an alien structure (resembling a large temple-like pyramid) and a team including Shaw, Holloway, and David explores it, while Vickers and Captain Janek (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0252961/?ref_=ttpl\">Idris Elba</a>) remain aboard the ship and monitor their progress. Mission director Meredith Vickers (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000234/?ref_=ttpl\">Charlize Theron</a>) orders them to avoid any direct contact and to return if the aliens are found.<br/><br/>Inside the pyramid, they discover a pocket of breathable air. In a dank chamber that David unlocks, they find hundreds of cylinder-like artifacts, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a giant alien, thought to be one of the Engineers. Other bodies are later found in the structure, and the species is presumed to be extinct. They view archive footage of holographic Engineers running down the corridors reacting to a long-ago emergency (also of note: the alien Engineers are dressed in the exact same bio-mechanical spacesuits that the dead alien \"Space Jockey\" wears in the crashed spaceship in the original Alien movie, thus confirming the connection between them as one and the same extraterrestrial species).<br/><br/>David secretly returns a cylinder to the ship, while the remaining cylinders in the chamber begin leaking a dark fluid, activated by the change in temperature or atmosphere when the chamber was opened. A rapidly approaching storm forces the crew to return to Prometheus, leaving crew members Milburn (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm1245863/?ref_=ttpl\">Rafe Spall</a>) and Fifield (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0365317/?ref_=ttpl\">Sean Harris</a>) stranded in the pyramid structure after becoming lost trying to find the way out. Shaw insists they take the Engineer\\'s head back to the ship with them and they barely make it back alive, David rescuing the couple when they\\'re blown off the loading platform.<br/><br/>In the ship, Shaw and medic Ford (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0225483/?ref_=ttpl\">Kate Dickie</a>) analyze the Engineer\\'s head, removing a heavy helmet with David\\'s help. They discover that its DNA is identical to that of the human race. Using an electrified needle, they bring the head temporarily back to life. However, exposure to the breathable atmosphere, causes the severed Engineer\\'s head to decompose rapidly and it disintegrates. Later, David investigates the cylinder and discovers several ampoules containing a viscous black fluid.<br/><br/>The crew of Prometheus discuss the meaning of life, the android David questions why he was created by man and Shaw questions her own existence as she is infertile and unable to create life.<br/><br/>David intentionally infects Holloway with the substance he found within the ampoule, hiding it in a drop of liquid on his finger and briefly dipping it into a glass of champagne Holloway drinks to celebrate their discovery. Later, Shaw and the infected Holloway have sex. Holloway later looks in a mirror and sees his eyes are changing; they are rheumy and he sees a small, silver worm-like organism emerge from one of his corneas.<br/><br/>Back inside the structure, Fifield and Milburn see a strange, snake-like creature emerge from a pool of the black fluid that has leaked from the cylinders. When Milburn tries to examine the creature, it quickly grabs his hand and wraps itself around his arm, breaking it in a matter of seconds. When Fifield tries to cut it off, a corrosive fluid (yellow acidic blood) from one of the creatures melts Fifield\\'s helmet, exposing him to the dark liquid leaking from the cylinders. The creature then works its way into his suit and forces itself down his throat.<br/><br/>The next morning after the storm subsides, the Prometheus crew returns to the structure and finds Milburn\\'s corpse. David discovers a room containing a living Engineer in stasis and a holographic star map highlighting several distant planetary systems. He watches as holograms of the Engineers activate a navigational system. One of the planets that eventually appears is Earth. Suddenly the system shuts down, leaving the hologram of Earth behind. David finds a single Engineer in a nearby stasis pod and can hear its heart beating.<br/><br/>Holloway\\'s infection rapidly ravages his body, and he is rushed back to the ship. As he visibly deteriorates, Vickers refuses to let him aboard, citing quarantine protocols. When he approaches Vickers, begging her to kill him, she burns him to death with a flamethrower. Shaw is devastated.<br/><br/>A medical scan reveals that Shaw, despite being sterile, is pregnant. David subdues her in order to return her to Earth in stasis. He takes the cross her father gave her, saying that it could be contaminated. She escapes and uses an automated medical surgery pod in Vickers\\' quarters to extract a horrific cephalopod-like creature from her abdomen while she is still conscious. Weyland is found to have been in stasis aboard the ship, and it\\'s revealed that Vickers is his daughter. Weyland explains to Shaw that he intends to ask the Engineers to help him avoid his impending death.<br/><br/>A mutated Fifield is discovered just outside the hanger bay and attacks and kills several crew members before being killed himself. Janek theorizes that the moon they are on was used by the Engineers as a military base until they lost control of their biological weapons, namely the cylinders and the black fluid they contain. The remaining crew return to the structure and awaken the Engineer, who is occupying what is discovered to be a space ship (the same design as the derelict alien space ship seen in <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/title/tt0078748/?ref_=ttpl\">Alien (1979)</a>).<br/><br/>David speaks an alien language to the Engineer, asking him why they made mankind and asking him to extend the life of his own creator, Mr. Weyland. The Engineer responds by ripping his head out and killing Weyland and Ford. Shaw escapes from the alien ship as it is activated by the Engineer.<br/><br/>The still-active David suggests the Engineer is going to release the ampoules of black fluid on Earth, thus killing every living creature in the planet. Vickers orders Janek to return to Earth, but Shaw convinces him to stop the Engineer\\'s ship. Janek and his two surviving crewmen take off and crash the Prometheus into the Engineer\\'s ship while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The disabled Engineer ship crashes onto the planet, falling onto Vickers, crushing her. Shaw barely escapes being crushed herself.<br/><br/>Shaw goes to the escape pod to retrieve supplies and finds that her aborted-but-still-alive alien offspring has grown to gigantic size. The Engineer survives the crash, enters the escape pod and attacks Shaw, who releases the tentacled creature. It subdues the Engineer by thrusting an ovipositor down its throat. Shaw believes she\\'s stranded on the planet until David contacts her and tells her that there are more of the Engineers ships elsewhere on the planet. She recovers David\\'s remains from the alien ship, taking back the cross David had taken from her, and together they travel to and activate another Engineer ship. Shaw and the remains of android David then take off to travel to the Engineers\\' homeworld, Paradise, in an attempt to understand why they created humanity and why they later attempted to destroy it.<br/><br/>In the final shot, in Vickers\\' escape pod, an alien creature (very similar to the xenomorph seen in the other <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/title/tt0078748/?ref_=ttpl\">Alien (1979)</a> movies) bursts out of the dying Engineer\\'s chest.</div></div>'}\n",

One year later, the Skynet system is activated, perceives humans as a threat to its own existence, and eradicates much of humanity in the event known as Judgment Day (see Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines). In 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) leads an attack by the Resistance on a Skynet base. John discovers human prisoners and the plans for the development of a new type of Terminator incorporating living tissue, but is the only apparent survivor of the attack after the base is destroyed in a small nuclear explosion. However, Marcus emerges from the wreckage of the base and proceeds on foot to Los Angeles.<br/><br/>John returns to Resistance headquarters located aboard a nuclear submarine and tells General Ashdown (Michael Ironside), the current leader, of his discovery. Meanwhile, the Resistance has discovered a radio frequency capable of shutting down Skynet machines. They plan to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco in four days, in response to an intercepted \"kill list\" indicating that Skynet plans to kill the Resistance\\'s command staff in four days\\' time. John learns that his own name is second on the list, following Kyle Reese. The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle\\'s importance to Skynet, but John knows that it is because Kyle will later become his father (see The Terminator). John meets with his officer Barnes (Common) and wife Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard) and sends radio broadcasts to Resistance members and surviving civilians around the world.<br/><br/>Arriving in the ruins of Los Angeles, Marcus is saved from a T-600 Terminator by Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and his mute companion Star (Jadagrace Berry). Kyle relates to Marcus the events of Judgment Day and the ensuing war between humans and machines. Hearing John\\'s radio broadcast, the three leave Los Angeles in search of the Resistance. On the way, they are spotted by a Skynet spy drone that identifies Kyle. They manage to destroy it and escape into the desert. <br/><br/>In the desert, Kyle spots a Resistance symbol at a seemingly abandoned 7-11. The man who meets them is hostile and refuses to lend them food or gasoline, but the compound\\'s leader, Virginia, refuses to let the trio leave until Star gets some food. The compound is suddenly attacked by a Harvester which grabs Virginia and a few others. Marcus and Kyle try to escape but are followed by Moto-terminators and an aerial HK. The Moto-terminators are destroyed in the chase but Kyle and Star are captured by the Harvester. The Resistance sends a couple of A-10 Warthogs which are shot down by an HK. <br/><br/>Marcus locates downed pilot Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) and they make their way to John\\'s base, but Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine. Attempting to save his life, the Resistance fighters discover that he is in fact a cyborg with human organs, a mechanical endoskeleton, circuitry, and a partially artificial cerebral cortex. Marcus believes himself to be human, demanding to be released so that he can save Kyle from Skynet, but John orders his destruction. However, Blair releases him and helps him to escape from the base. During the resulting pursuit Marcus saves John\\'s life from Skynet hydrobots, and the two form an alliance. Marcus will enter Skynet\\'s headquarters and attempt to disable its defenses so that John can rescue Kyle.<br/><br/>John demands that Ashdown delay the attack so that he can rescue Kyle and the other prisoners, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, John\\'s soldiers remain loyal to him and he sends a radio broadcast asking the other Resistance fighters not to attack Skynet. Meanwhile, Marcus enters the Skynet base and interfaces with the computer, disabling the perimeter defenses and allowing John to infiltrate the cell block and release the human prisoners. The Resistance\\'s disabling signal is revealed to be a ruse, and the command submarine with the Resistance leaders aboard is destroyed by a Hunter-Killer.<br/><br/>Marcus discovers that he was created by Skynet and has unwittingly fulfilled his programmed mission to lure John into the base to be killed. He tears out the hardware linking him to Skynet and leaves to assist John in battling a T-800 model 101 Terminator. John is mortally wounded during the fight, but succeeds in destroying the Skynet base by rigging several Terminator nuclear power cells to an explosive, detonating them as he, Marcus, Kyle, and Star are airlifted out. Kate attempts to save John\\'s life, but his heart is too damaged. Marcus offers his heart for transplant, sacrificing himself to save John. Recovering, John radios to the other Resistance fighters that though this battle has been won, the war is far from over. [D-Man2010]</div></div>'}\n",

Joe: The Rise of Cobra. The Nanomite threat has been neutralized, and the U.S. government has imprisoned Cobra Commander and Destro in an inescapable subterranean prison. When the leader of Pakistan is assassinated, the U.S. president (Jonathan Pryce) calls on the Joes to secure Pakistan\\'s nuclear warheads before they fall into enemy hands. In the wake of successfully completing their mission, however, the Joes are decimated in a devastating surprise attack. When the smoke clears, Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), and Flint (D.J. Cotrona) are the sole survivors. They\\'re convinced that something is amiss in the White House, and as Lady Jaye theorizes that an impostor is pretending to be the commander in chief, bad guys Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-Hun) and Firefly (Ray Stevenson) team up to break Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) out of prison. Later, as Storm Shadow retreats into the mountains to recover from burns incurred in the extraction, Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Jinx (Elodie Yung) manage to capture the elusive white ninja, in the process discovering a shocking secret about his past and learning that Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), posing as the president, has called an international summit to discuss nuclear disarmament in order to bring the leaders of the world to their knees before the diabolical Cobra Commander.

Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) is keeping an eye out and Mouse (Joseph Mazzello) is serving as a standby sniper. Roadblock uses some supercharged gloves that get so hot they melt the woven wire fence so the men can get through. On signal, Mouse shoots a coffee mug from the hand of one of the guards to create a diversion and the three scamper on to their destinations. Roadblock and Duke go to where some buildings and vehicles are and they capture/rescue a man from the back of a truck. Meanwhile, Flint has gone directly onto the guard tower and replaced the N. Korean flag with that of the G.I. Joe\\'s.<br/><br/>There\\'s a brief narration explaining how the Joes caught Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) and Destro (in the previous film), and they are now locked in a maximum security prison. Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) are still at large. Duke is the captain, charged with leading Roadblock, Flint, Jaye, and the masked mute Snake Eyes (Ray Park). (Note: no mention is made of the Baroness whom is presumed to be still incarcerated).<br/><br/>After completing their mission in Korea, Duke and Roadblock are playing video games at the Roadblock\\'s home. Duke gets jumped on playfully by Roadblock\\'s two young daughters, distracting him from the game as he must stop to wrestle with them.<br/><br/>Duke and Roadblock pause briefly to watch a news story on television about the Pakistani president having been assassinated.<br/><br/>Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), who is impersonating the President of the United States (Jonathan Pryce), meets with his advisors and asks for opinions about what the U.S. should do about the situation in Pakistan. A pentagon general recommends going in. A civilian advisor recommends waiting it out. The Zartan president decides to send the G.I. Joes to Pakistan to capture and neutralize a nuclear device the government had developed so it can\\'t be used by those who assassinated the Pakistani president.<br/><br/>The Joes travel to Pakistan. They are lowered onto the roof of the building where the weapon is located. They fan out and within short order, locate the weapon on the ground floor and start shooting their way into and down the four levels of the structure. Within minutes, they have control of the building and the weapon and remove it from the country. Duke contacts the White House to confirm this.<br/><br/>Zartan enters an underground facility where the Cobras are hiding the real President. Zartan taunts the President and shows off the nanomites that keep his disguise together, by taking a knife and drawing it across his face. The skin changes color but quickly heals itself. Zartan observes that the people of America prefer a President who looks like the real one, but acts like Zartan is acting, bold and aggressive, with a penchant for blowing things up.<br/><br/>At their compound in the desert, Duke and Roadblock make a bet on who can shoot the flame of a candle in a cupcake perched on top of a stick. Duke goes first, but misses because Roadblock keeps talking and taunting him. Roadblock then pulls out a massive machine gun and blows apart the entire cupcake, claiming victory. Duke now has to baby sit Roadblocks two daughters for one night.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the men notice a group attack helicopters approaching and they think maybe it\\'s additional security. However, the helicopters start shooting at the Joes and dropping bombs. They destroy all the vehicles and kill numerous people. The team scrambles for protection while firing back. Duke jumps in to save Flint, but he is killed in an explosion. Roadblock, Flint, and Jaye hide in a deep water well and manage to escape detection.<br/><br/>The next morning, as the trio struggle to climb out of the well, President Zartan addresses the nation regarding the attack. He accuses the Joes of attacking Pakistan and stealing a nuclear weapon. He also accuses Snake Eyes for the assassination of the Pakistani president. Zartan announces on television that the G.I. Joes have been eliminated as a result of all their misdeeds.<br/><br/>Roadblock, Flint, and Jaye finally get out of the water well. As the only surviving Joes, they take off on foot across the desert, set on exacting revenge for their dead.<br/><br/>At a maximum-security prison in Germany, Snake Eyes has been captured and is being taken in to join Cobra Commander and Destro in captivity. He is escorted by Warden James (Walton Goggins) to a room deep underground where he is placed in a tube filled with a liquid medium that paralyzes every part of the body but allows the heart and eyes to remain functioning. James says, \"Welcome to hell\" and then removes Snake Eye\\'s mask, revealing that it is really Storm Shadow and not Snake Eyes.<br/><br/>A Cobra mercenary known as Firefly (Ray Stevenson) comes roaring up to the facility and sets out little explosive fireflies to break into the place. As this is happening, Storm Shadow makes his heart stop to alert the guards after he\\'s been placed in the chamber. He manages to break out and kill most of the guards. He breaks Cobra Commander from his chamber, but they leave Destro, saying he is out of the band. They meet with Firefly, who comes in as James shoots a gas chamber, causing an explosion. James is killed by the Commander and the explosion\\'s flames severely burn Storm Shadow\\'s back.<br/><br/>Cobra Commander directs that Storm Shadow be taken to a temple high in the Himalayas to recover from his injuries.<br/><br/>In Tokyo, Japan, upon learning that Storm Shadow is alive, the Blind Master (RZA), leader of the Arashikage Clan, sends the real Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and his apprentice Jinx (Elodie Yung), Storm Shadow\\'s cousin, to capture Storm Shadow and get him to reveal Cobra\\'s plans, and also to answer for the murder of his uncle, the Hard Master.<br/><br/>The villains go to an industrial complex where a large weapon known as Zeus is being constructed. President Zartan comes in and informs Cobra Commander about the three surviving Joes. Firefly says they\\'ll be taken care of.<br/><br/>Roadblock, Flint, and Jaye drop by Roadblock\\'s old neighborhood. They take shelter in an old gym/arcade that he used to frequent.<br/><br/>After President Zartan announces that Cobra will replace the Joes as America\\'s main protective unit, Lady Jaye does some technical analysis of the known President\\'s speech pattern and mannerisms with that of the suspected imposter, deducing that someone is impersonating the real president. Flint asks Roadblock who in government they can possibly trust now, and he responds there is one man he knows.<br/><br/>Roadblock leads them to the home of General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), the original G.I. Joe. Roadblock explains the situation after showing Colton the dog tags of their fallen brothers. Together, they come up with a plan to prove that the President is a phony.<br/><br/>Colton provides them with weapons, and helps them infiltrate a fundraising event that the President will be attending. Lady Jaye steals a sample of the President\\'s DNA and confirms that he is Zartan. They escape after a brief confrontation with Firefly and Zandar (Matt Gerald), the head of the Presidential Detail and a member of Cobra.<br/><br/>Jaye goes out pretending to be jogging home with her groceries and attracts the attention of a man on the President\\'s detail. She tricks him into helping her out with her groceries, and Roadblock gets him to find them a way to the President.<br/><br/>High in the Himalayas, Snake Eyes and Jinx have located the place where Storm Shadow is being treated. He has healed up by an old woman, and as he is getting dressed following removal of his bandages, he notices that several ninjas are falling past the window from great heights. As he rushes out to see what\\'s going on, he comes across Snake Eyes in the passageway. They engage in a fight, while Jinx appears in the other room and fights the old woman. The old woman and Storm Shadow are subdued after some furious fighting. Snake Eyes and Jinx bundle Storm Shadow into a body bag and fasten the bag to a rope. Numerous ninjas appear and go after Snake Eyes and Jinx in an attempt to rescue Storm Shadow. After numerous battles along the sides of the mountains as they and the Ninjas slide on their ropes and rappel along the rocks, Snake Eyes and Jinx manage to escape. They return to Japan.<br/><br/>Back in Tokyo, Storm Shadow is questioned by Blind Master, who hands him his sword. In this moment, it is revealed that, as a child, it was not Storm Shadow who killed his and Snake Eyes\\' master, but it was Zartan in disguise as a man who would mentor Storm Shadow into the assassin he became. Storm Shadow reveals that he joined Cobra to avenge his uncle. He gives them the information they want.<br/><br/>Storm Shadow then accompanies Snake Eyes and Jinx as they join the Joes\\' efforts to stop Cobra.<br/><br/>At the fundraiser that President Zartan is attending, Jaye goes in disguised as a member of the President\\'s detail. She gets in with a sexy red dress and gets Zartan\\'s attention. One of his men, another Cobra ally, is suspicious and starts to do a scan on Jaye\\'s face. She gets out after getting a hair sample from Zartan\\'s coat and sends it to Roadblock. After scanning the sample, they learn Zartan\\'s identity, just as Firefly comes in and tries to attack. He fights Roadblock and almost kills him until Flint and Jaye come by and ram him with their truck. Firefly gets out in time.<br/><br/>In the gym/arcade, Snake Eyes, Jinx, and Storm Shadow come across the Joes, who are initially suspicious, but they join forces. They go back to Colton\\'s place and meet with some of Colton\\'s men to come up with a plan to stop Cobra\\'s plans. Colton shows them his HUGE collection of weapons all over the kitchen and they start preparing.<br/><br/>Firefly is beating the President up in the underground chamber. Cobra Commander comes in with a briefcase that would activate the Zeus weapon and scans the President\\'s eye in order to gain control of the weapon.<br/><br/>Zartan invites the leaders of the world\\'s nuclear powers to a summit at Fort Sumter, where he blackmails them into disabling their nuclear arsenals by first launching America\\'s nukes into the air and then detonating them as they are high above the sky to show his commitment to disarmament. The other world leaders had also launched their missiles and then follow suit in destroying them. It\\'s then that Zartan reveals that he has created Project Zeus: seven orbital kinetic bombardment weapons of mass destruction, that are at his command.<br/><br/>They launch one rod at London, almost completely destroying it, and sending the other world leaders into a frenzy. He threatens to destroy the other capitals if the leaders don\\'t submit to Cobra. By this point, Cobra has officially taken over the White House. Storm Shadow betrays Cobra Commander and kills Zartan, revealing Cobra\\'s deception to the world leaders. While Snake Eyes, Jinx, and Flint fight Cobra\\'s soldiers, Cobra Commander activates the remaining six weapons and instructs Firefly to protect the briefcase containing the launch device. Firefly is killed in combat by Roadblock, who deactivates and destroys the orbital weapons.<br/><br/>Roadblock comes in on a fast attack tank shooting the other villains\\' tanks while Jaye and Colton go retrieve the President. After shooting their way through dozens of goons, the duo find the underground chamber as one Cobra ally holds the President at gunpoint. Jaye shoots the President in the arm to drop him out of the way and Colton then kills the goon.<br/><br/>Flint goes in pursuit of Cobra Commander, but he escapes on a helicopter, just as his men are preparing for the other Zeus rods to hit other major cities around the world. Roadblock finds that Firefly is holding the briefcase. He nearly escapes on a motorboat, but Roadblock rams into it with another one. He and Firefly begin fighting again, but Roadblock manages to defeat him. At the very last second, he overrides the sequence and causes all the Zeus satellites to explode.<br/><br/>Somewhere underground, after having escaped other ninjas, Storm Shadow finds Zartan pointing a gun at him. He tells Zartan he made him what he has become, and Zartan pulls the trigger, but Storm Shadow slices the bullet in half with his blade and throws it into Zartan\\'s chest. As he dies, the nanomites wear off, and his real face is visible.<br/><br/>Roadblock is walking away from the scene, but Firefly is about to set one of his firefly bombs on him. He reaches into his pocket for his detonator, but Roadblock is holding it. With the push of a button, the firefly explodes, and Firefly is killed. The Joes walk together triumphantly while Storm Shadow respectfully acknowledges Snake Eyes and walks away.<br/><br/>The real President is put back into power and addresses the nation at a ceremony where Roadblock, Jaye, Flint, Jinx, and Snake Eyes are commemorated as heroes. Colton thanks each of them, but when he gets to Roadblock, he presents him with a M1911 pistol that belonged to General George S. Patton, to use when he finally finds Cobra Commander. Roadblock proudly raises the weapon and lets out a single shot in honor of his fallen comrades.</div></div>'}\n",

But, one day, Guy has a chance encounter with mysterious Millie, the woman of his dreams, and just like that, he\\'s on the brink of making an eye-opening, life-altering discovery. Now, to win her heart, all that Guy has to do is take control of his life, one step at a time. And then, out of the blue, Millie decides to drop a bombshell. However, is she telling the truth? Above all, if life is nothing but a game, what will it take for ordinary Guy to level up and get the girl?<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=Nick%20Riganas&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_3\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Nick Riganas</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">Free City is an online, open-world video game developed by Soonami Games. Its source code was stolen from an unreleased game called Life Itself, developed by Walter \"Keys\" McKey and Millie Rusk, and used by Soonami\\'s head developer Antwan Hovachelik to create Free City. Keys has since taken a job at Soonami, while Millie spends time within Free City as her avatar Molotov Girl to find evidence of code that she and Keys had written and to prove that they are the rightful owners of the code.<br/><br/>In the game, Guy, a non-player character (NPC), works as a bank teller and spends time with his best friend and co-worker, bank security guard Buddy, unaware that his world is a video game. One day, he encounters Molotov Girl, who is singing the song that he says his dream girl will like and begins to deviate from his programming. He takes a pair of sunglasses from a player who tries to rob his bank, through which he sees Free City from the player\\'s head-up display (HUD). Guy speaks to Millie, who initially thinks he is another player named \"Blue Shirt Guy\" and not an NPC. She tells him to level up to above 100 before she will speak to him again. Keys and his coworker Mouser believe Guy to be a hacker disguised as an NPC and unsuccessfully attempt to ban him from the game. Rather than leveling up through destructive acts, Guy opts to perform good deeds, completing missions within Free City to reach level 102. His virtuous progression, which stands out from those of other players, results in \"Blue Shirt Guy\" becoming a worldwide sensation.<br/><br/>Millie and Guy meet again when she breaks into the Stash, another player\\'s well-protected compound that holds evidence of her source code. Guy helps Millie escape the Stash, and Millie is bewildered when Guy wants to kiss her. Keys realizes that Guy is truly an NPC, and that his self-awareness came about from artificial intelligence (AI) code containing Millie\\'s personal preferences that Keys had included in Life Itself, which in turn had led Guy to develop a romantic interest in Millie. In addition, Guy\\'s subsequent interactions with other NPCs have led them to develop self-awareness as well. Keys decides to help Millie retrieve their code before Free City is wiped from Soonami\\'s servers to make way for its sequel, Free City 2, in two days. When Millie tells Guy the truth of his situation, Guy breaks off their relationship, telling her that he is in love with her. However, after talking with Buddy about the situation, Guy realizes that there was something more than love in their relationship and gains full sentience. Guy returns to Millie and agrees to help.<br/><br/>Guy breaks into the Stash again with Buddy\\'s help, where its owner, recognizing Guy, hands over the evidence. Guy\\'s continued popularity threatens the launch of Free City 2, and Antwan orders Keys and Mouser to reboot the entire game, but Keys refuses and Antwan reboots the game himself.<br/><br/>In the game, Millie finds Guy without any memories of his sentience, but recalling Keys\\' advice that Guy would need a reminder, she kisses him. Guy\\'s sentience is restored, and he recalls the location of the Island, part of Life Itself that will not be protected from the pending data wipe and which is the only proof of Millie and Keys\\' original code. Antwan then tries to directly eliminate Guy and Molotov Girl from the game by raising their \"wanted level\" to maximum, but as Guy and Millie have persuaded the other NPCs in the game that they are more than their programming, they no longer respond to outside commands and refuse to interfere. Antwan then resorts to directly manipulating the game topography to kill Guy and Molotov Girl, while Keys makes his own changes to protect and direct them to the Island, broadcasting the effort to all of the Free City players who had been ejected from the game. Antwan fires Keys and then sends Dude, a muscular, unfinished copy of Guy developed for Free City 2, into the game. Unable to defeat him in direct combat, Guy puts his sunglasses onto Dude, the HUD distracting the far-less mature AI indefinitely.<br/><br/>Antwan then enters Soonami\\'s server room and begins destroying the game\\'s servers with a fire axe in a last-ditch attempt to prevent his theft from being revealed, leading Mouser to discover Antwan\\'s crimes and get fired, but Guy makes it to the Island before he can destroy the last one, an event that is seen by gamers all over the world. With the theft revealed, Antwan holds the remaining server hostage and demands that Millie abandon her lawsuit and surrender the Free City intellectual property (IP), along with the profits from the game. Millie, believing the real value of the game is in its programming, enthusiastically agrees; the game\\'s inhabitants are saved.<br/><br/>Without Millie and Keys\\' code, Free City 2 is a catastrophic failure at launch, Antwan is vilified by the media for his now-exposed crimes and he is arrested for theft and criminal damage. Keys, Mouser, and Millie start a successful new company with the recovered code to release Free Life, bringing Guy, Buddy, Dude, and the other Free City NPCs into it. Thanks to Guy, Millie realizes that Keys\\' code was in fact a love letter to her, and they embrace and kiss. Guy reunites with Buddy, and they begin to live their own lives in Free Life without having to follow their original Free City coding.</div></div>'}\n",

Much to Flint\\'s dismay, his father Tim joins the crew and they travel to Swallow Falls on his fishing boat.<br/><br/>Upon arriving back at Swallow Falls, they notice that a jungle-like environment has overgrown the island. Tim stays behind while Flint and the others investigate, finding a vast habitat of living food animals. Tim, searching for food at his abandoned tackle shop, encounters a family of humanoid pickles and bonds with them by fishing. Chester discovers that Flint allowed his friends to join on the mission and arrives on the island with Barb, chagrined and determined to separate them. After escaping a Tacodile attack, Sam notices that the foodimal was protecting its family, and begins to suspect Chester is up to no good. Flint finds his former lab and invents a device that can track the FLDSMDFR. Sam attempts to convince Flint to spare the foodimals, but Flint is intent on making Chester proud. Sam leaves in anger, along with the others (including Steve). In the jungle, Sam proves that the foodimals mean no harm by taming a Cheespider. Upon realizing Chester\\'s intentions, the group is then ambushed by Live Corp employees.<br/><br/>Flint finds the FLDSMDFR, but notices a family of cute marshmallows and becomes hesitant to destroy the machine. Chester immediately seizes control of the FLDSMDFR and announces his plot to make his updated line of food bars out of the foodimals. A crushed Flint is knocked into the river but rescued by the marshmallows. Flint is taken to his father, who along with the foodimals, help him infiltrate the Live Corp building that is under construction on the island. Flint frees the trapped Foodimals and confronts Chester, who threatens to make food bars out of his friends. Chester makes several holograms of himself to overwhelm Flint, but Flint uses the \"Party-In-A-Box\" to expose the real Chester. An army of Foodimals arrive and Flint\\'s friends are freed by Barb, having a change of heart. Chester tries to make off with the FLDSMDFR, but is eaten by a Cheespider. With the island safe from Chester and Live Corp destroyed, Flint returns the FLDSMDFR to its place and the foodimals continue to live in peace as more are born. The film ends with Flint fishing with his father for the first time, finding it enjoyable.</div></div>'}\n",

He is happily married to Lori (Sharon Stone), but is dissatisfied with his place in life. She teases him about a recurring nightmare about being on Mars with a beautiful woman who is not his wife. On the way to work he sees an advertisement on the subway TV for Rekall, Inc., a facility that implants fake memories of ideal vacations. Against the advice of his co-worker Harry (Robert Costanzo), Doug visits Rekall and orders a special package that will implant memories of an adventure trip on Mars as a secret agent. Before the procedure begins, he is asked to select a woman of his choice. He chooses a brunette, with an athletic body, and a sleazy and demure personality.<br/><br/>Before the memory implantation procedure can begin, Quaid goes into a violent rage, ranting about his cover being blown and how men are coming to kill him. He tries to break free of his restraints, and the Rekall director tries to calm Quaid. Quaid responds by throttling him and muttering, \"My name is not Quaid!\" The technicians tranquilize him and he falls unconscious. The Rekall director believes that Doug was acting out the secret agent part of the trip, but learns that the memories have not yet been implanted. The technicians realize that Doug\\'s memory had previously been erased. To cover their involvement, the Rekall director orders his team to erase his memories of Rekall, refund his credits, and send him home.<br/><br/>Quaid awakens in a Johnny Cab (with a robotic driver) that takes him to a subway station where he can catch a train home. While walking through the subway, he is attacked and detained by several men led by Harry, his co-worker. They accuse him of blabbing about Mars while he was at Rekall, although because Rekall erased his memory, Quaid cannot remember anything about Rekall or being on Mars. Harry prepares to shoot Quaid, but Quaid fights back, successfully killing Harry and all of his men. He doesn\\'t understand where he obtained his newfound hand-to-hand skills and is horrified at his actions.<br/><br/>Quaid rushes back home to Lori and tells her what happened. She recognizes that he\\'s regained his memory of Mars and attacks him. They fight and Doug subdues and interrogates her. Holding a gun that he took from her to her head, Quaid pressures Lori into revealing that his original identity has been erased and a new one implanted, which included her as his wife so she could watch over him for past six weeks. An astonished Quaid asks, \"If I\\'m not me, who the hell am I?\"<br/><br/>A video monitor in Quaid\\'s apartment displays the arrival of several men with weapons outside their apartment building. Quaid knocks Lori out and flees. He is pursued by Lori\\'s real husband Richter (Michael Ironside), an agent of a mysterious Agency led by Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox), the corporate dictator of Mars. Richter is intent on killing Quaid who he apparently knew on Mars. Lori greets Richter as her real-life husband. Richter and his men try to kill Quaid as they chase him through the streets and into an underground subway station. As Quaid escapes he kills some of Richter\\'s men. Cohaagen contacts Richter and asks about the gunfight. Richter explains that he is \"trying to neutralize a traitor.\" Cohaagen angrily orders Richter not to kill Quaid because they still need him. He tells Richter that Quaid must be captured alive for re-implantation. Richter, intent on killing Quaid, pretends he has a bad connection and hangs up. Richter\\'s right-hand man, Helm, tells Richter they\\'ve located Quaid using a tracking device.<br/><br/>Doug finds a room in a cheap, anonymous hotel, but a mysterious man calls him in his room and tells him he as a suitcase for him. Quaid, puzzled, asks who he is. The man says they were agents together on Mars. He tells Quaid that there is a bug inside his head that allows Richter to track him. Following the man\\'s instructions, Quaid wraps his head in a wet towel to disrupt the tracking signal. He gets the suitcase and as he is leaving the hotel Richter and Helm arrive. They chase Quaid in another Johnny Cab taxi who escapes their violent pursuit and flees to an abandoned factory. Though Quaid is still wearing the towel on his head, they\\'re able to track a faint signal.<br/><br/>When Quaid opens the case a screen plays a recording of himself. He finds a variety of spy gear inside the suitcase. The recording tells Quaid he was originally Hauser, a high-ranking member of the \"Agency\" and Cohaagen\\'s key agent. In the recording, Hauser tells Quaid that he met Melina (Rachel Ticotin), an agent for rebels on Mars, and that she convinced him to switch sides. Hauser says that Cohaagen discovered his treason, the Agency erased his identity and a new one implanted. In the new identity, Quaid was exiled to Earth where he could be closely watched. Hauser tells Quaid how to remove the tracking device from his skull. After Quaid successfully (and painfully) extracts the bug, Hauser tells him to go to Mars and connect with the rebels to help destroy Cohaagen\\'s empire. Quaid stuffs the bug inside a candy bar and throws it to some nearby rats and flees, leaving Richter, Helm &amp; their men to chase the bug around the factory.<br/><br/>Quaid arrives on Mars at a giant domed mining colony half-buried in the martian landscape. Many of the people living on Mars are deformed and possess psychic abilities caused by the mixture of solar radiation and shoddy air quality provided by Cohaagen. Cohaagen\\'s men follow Quaid to Mars. They see some recent graffiti proclaiming that the mysterious mutant leader \"Kuato\" is still a threat. They zero Quaid when the disguise he\\'s wearing, a lifelike mask of a large woman, fails and he\\'s exposed. They open fire and crack one of the shielding windows, causing a sudden decompression in the room. One of the customs agents is able to hit an emergency button and the rush of air stops. Quaid escapes.<br/><br/>One a train from the customs station, Quaid sees the giant mountain housing the Pyramid Mine, which supplies an enormous amount of turbinium, an ore vital to a major war back on Earth, in the distance and asks another passenger about it. The passenger tells Quaid he worked there until they found alien artifacts there &amp; shut the mine down. Quaid suggests it\\'s just a rumor but the other man scoffs at the idea.<br/><br/>Richter meets with Cohaagen and receives a furious chewing out over his reckless behavior while trying to kill Quaid. He also tells Richter that he deliberately has kept vital information from him so they can capture Quaid alive and finally find Kuato and kill him.<br/><br/>Quaid gets a suite at the Hilton and retrieves a note from a hotel safe that he left for himself. It tells him to contact Melina at The Last Resort. Outside the hotel, a mutant taxi driver named Benny (Mel Johnson Jr.), persuades Quaid to let him take him to Venusville and The Last Resort, a bar and brothel. Quaid finds Melina, who strongly resembles the woman he requested at Rekall, but he can\\'t remember her and she doesn\\'t believe his story. She orders him to leave at gunpoint.<br/><br/>Quaid returns to the Hilton and is visited by Dr. Edgemar (Roy Brocksmith), the founder of Rekall, whom Quaid saw in a Rekall ad on Earth. Edgemar tells Quaid that everything that has happened since his trip to Rekall is all in his mind and that he\\'s actually back at Rekall, still strapped into the chair in the lab. He says everything Quaid has experienced since falling unconscious at Rekall on planet Earth has been a dream due to a \"schizoid embolism\" and \"acute neurological trauma\". Quaid, disbelieving, holds him at gunpoint. Edgemar tells Quaid his entire experience matches the dreams he asked to be implanted.<br/><br/>To prove his point, Edgemar opens the hotel door and Lori enters. She pleads with Quaid to listen to Dr. Edgemar. Edgemar offers Doug a pill, \"a symbol of his desire to return to reality.\" He says Quaid must take the pill voluntarily to escape his permanent dream state. If he does, he will fall asleep and then wake up at the memory implant facility on Earth. He tells Quaid that if he doesn\\'t take the pill, he will end up lobotomized and his mind will be trapped in this alternate reality forever. Quaid seriously considers the offer, but before he can swallow the pill, he spots a drop of sweat on the nervous Dr. Edgemar\\'s face. He thinks this confirms that he is experiencing reality and not a dream and immediately shoots and kills Edgemar. A team of men break suddenly break through the room\\'s walls and capture Quaid. Lori deals him several painful blows, the last one knocking him unconscious.<br/><br/>Lori and Richter\\'s men take the subdued and shackled Quaid to an elevator. When the elevator doors open, Melina opens fire with a sub-machine gun, killing all but Lori. Melina and Lori fight, but just as Lori is about to stab Melina with a knife, Quaid shoots the knife out of her hand. She looks up, telling he wouldn\\'t hurt her because they\\'re married. Seeing her reaching for a gun, Quaid shoots her dead, replying, \"Consider that a divorce.\"<br/><br/>Richter and Helm burst out of the elevator. Richter sees Lori\\'s dead body and marches after Quaid and Melina. Helm stops Richter when he tries to shoot at Quaid while he stands in front of a protective dome pane. They flee the hotel where Benny is conveniently waiting for them. He takes them to Venusville and The Last Resort. They hide behind a secret panel. The rebels and Cohaagen\\'s security forces engage in a firefight during which Helm and several of Richter\\'s security forces are killed. Richter barely escapes and takes command of a platoon of reinforcements. Cohaagen calls Richter after hearing about the firefight and orders him to pull back. Richter and his men retreat and the entire neighborhood is sealed off and the oxygen circulation system and fans feeding the area fresh air are turned off.<br/><br/>Quaid is taken by the rebels to meet Kuato, the mysterious leader of the rebellion. Kuato is psychic and can spot undercover Martian agents and extract information from them. They hope that Kuato can read Quaid\\'s mind and find key information that will help them defeat Cohaagen and free Mars from his dictatorship. They take Quaid to see George (Marshall Bell), a high ranking rebel officer, before he can meet Kuato. They meet George in a private room, who opens his shirt to reveal that he is also Kuato, a conjoined, symbiotic creature with only a small head and arms. Kuato reads Quaid\\'s mind and sees a vision of alien ruins, that have been rumored to lie underneath Mars. Cohaagen has kept their existence secret because it would convert the turbinium and make it worthless. The machine, if activated, would melt an underground glacier and release the oxygen, creating a breathable atmosphere for Mars.<br/><br/>The rebel hideout is attacked by Cohaagen\\'s forces who massacre the rebels. Quaid, Melina, Benny and George/Kuato flee. As they prepare to escape, Benny suddenly shoots George/Kuato, revealing that he is a covert agent of Cohaagen. Before Kuato dies, he tells Quaid to start the reactor. Richter finishes Kuato off and takes Quaid and Melina to Cohaagen.<br/><br/>In his office, Cohaagen smugly explains to Quaid that the entire operation was a trap conceived by Hauser and Cohaagen. They devised a plan to trick Kuato by erasing Hauser\\'s memory and implanting memories making him into Quaid so he could pass Kuato\\'s psychic test. Quaid doesn\\'t believe Cohaagen, but Cohaagen plays a recording made by Hauser before he became Quaid. Hauser, with Cohaagen at his side, congratulates Quaid for helping wipe out the rebels. Cohaagen orders that the oxygen supply to a large part of the Mars colony that aided the rebels be completely cut off.<br/><br/>Quaid and Melina are taken to a memory implant facility so that Hauser\\'s memories and personality can be restored. Melina will be implanted with memories making her subservient. During the memory programming procedure, Quaid escapes from his chair, frees Melina, and kills the tech workers and all the guards. The two head down to the alien ruins. Quaid explains to Melina that Kuato helped him remember that the ruins are actually reactors that will create enough air for the entire planet, and would thus cause Cohaagen to lose control of Mars.<br/><br/>Quaid and Melina get to the ruins. They are attacked by Benny, who is driving a gigantic mining drilling machine. Quaid impales Benny with a power mining drill. They then find a way to the reactor, where a large platoon of soldiers, led by Richter, are waiting for them. Doug utilizes a hologram device to confuse the soldiers while he and Melina gun them all down. Richter boards a freight elevator that ascends to the ruins\\' control panel. Quaid jumps on and the two fight, ending with Richter having his arms ripped off and falling to his death.<br/><br/>Quaid makes it to the reactor control area, where Cohaagen is waiting for him; he has rigged the control facility to explode, and is just about to kill Quaid when he is shot and wounded by Melina. He activates the bomb, but Quaid throws it away before it detonates. The explosion rips a hole in the wall, causing depressurization. As Quaid and Melina hang on for dear life, Cohaagen is sucked into the atmosphere and lands in the Martian landscape, where he quickly dies from the lack of oxygen and the massive solar radiation. Quaid manages to turn the reactor on just before he and Melina are sucked into the atmosphere as well, but they are saved as the reactor releases a large amount of breathable air, which washes over the entire atmosphere. The rushing force of the new air smashes through all the protective windows of the colony. The people who were dying can now breathe freely again.<br/><br/>As Quaid and Melina gaze in astonishment at the Martian sky, which is now blue and clouded, Quaid wonders if he really is having a dream and if all of this is really happening in his head back on Earth at Rekall. Hearing this, Melina invites him to: \"kiss me quick before you wake up.\" He and Melina kiss as the screen fades to white.</div></div>'}\n",

When Jennifer grows to eager to know what happened to her and Marty, Doc uses a sleep-inducing alpha rhythm generator to put her to sleep and keep her from asking questions.<br/><br/>After landing the time machine in an alleyway near the Hill Valley courthouse, Doc and Marty deposit Jennifer on a nearby loading dock, before Marty changes into some clothing provided by Doc. It is then that Doc explains to Marty that on this day, Marty\\'s son Marty McFly Jr (Michael J Fox) gets talked into doing something illegal by Griff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) and his gang. Marty is supposed to take his son\\'s place and refuse to go along with the scheme, while Doc uses the alpha rhythm generator to detain Marty Jr, until Marty completes his mission.<br/><br/>Marty then strolls out onto the town square, enamored by all the changes that have taken place in the last 30 years. For a moment, he stops and looks in the window of an antique store called \"Blast from the Past,\" which has a number of vintage items, including a sports almanac.<br/><br/>Making his way to the \"Cafe 80\\'s,\" Marty is surprised to run into an older Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson), who berates Marty McFly Jr\\'s \"old man\" to be a loser. Before Marty can find out more information, Griff shows up, and drags his grandfather outside to finish waxing his car. Things get tense for Marty when Marty Jr DOES show up, and he ducks out-of-sight.<br/><br/>Marty is shocked to find out that his son is \"a complete wimp,\" but when Marty Jr angers Griff, the manic Tannen throws Marty Jr over the nearby counter, knocking the kid out. Marty then takes his son\\'s place and refuses to give into Griff\\'s demands, but as he attempts to walk out the door, Griff calls Marty \"a chicken.\" Marty is about to attack Griff, when Griff pulls out a hidden baseball bat, and almost takes his head off!<br/><br/>Marty rushes outside, and takes a hoverboard from a little girl. Griff\\'s gang gives chase, and Marty is able to get away, before the board coasts to a stop over the Courthouse Square\\'s duck pond.<br/><br/>Griff uses the opportunity to pull out his heavy-duty Pitbull hoverboard, and once his gang hooks on, they attempt to mow down Marty. At the last minute, Marty manages to duck, causes the bully and his gang to fly right into the Courthouse\\'s windows, and crash on through!<br/><br/>In the aftermath, Marty attempts to return the hoverboard, but the little girl lets him keep it, having absconded with Griff\\'s Pitbull hoverboard. After this, Marty encounters an old man named Terry (Charles Fleischer) who asks Marty for funds to save the clock tower, when a news graphic pops up showing the Chicago Cubs have won the World Series, against the Miami Gators. When Terry comments how he wishes he could have put some money on the Cubs, Marty gets an idea.<br/><br/>Returning to the \"Blast from the Past\" store, Marty purchases the \"Grey\\'s Sports Alamanac\" he saw earlier. On his way out, he encounters Doc landing the DeLorean, before having to explain about the crowd gathered in front of the Courthouse. Doc is at first incensed that Marty Jr showed up (blaming the use of the sleep-inducer on Jennifer for not giving the proper knockout dosage), but the two soon realize that because of the hoverboarding incident, Griff will go to jail, and Marty\\'s family is saved!<br/><br/>As they prepare to retrieve Jennifer, Doc finds the sports almanac, and lectures Marty for attempting to use time-travel for financial gain. Throwing the almanac in a nearby trash can, Doc and Marty then find out some local police officers have found Jennifer. Overhearing that they\\'re taking her back to her home in Hilldale, the two take off in pursuit...unaware that old Biff has heard what they said, and retrieves the thrown-away sports almanac.<br/><br/>After she is returned to the McFly house, Jennifer hides in a closet, as she sees the family prepare for dinner. Their daughter Marlene (Michael J Fox) greets Grandma Lorraine (Lea Thompson) and Grandpa George (Jeffrey Weissman) as they arrive. When Lorraine mentions the broken scene-screen, Marlene mentions how Marty got upset with the repairman for calling him a chicken. Lorraine once again brings up an automobile accident Marty had with a Rolls-Royce 30 years ago, all because someone called him chicken.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Doc and Marty have landed nearby. Doc takes his dog Einstein with him to retrieve Jennifer, and leaves Marty with the DeLorean. However, Marty is soon distracted by an automatic dog-walker, and doesn\\'t see old Biff get out of a cab, and steal the time machine!<br/><br/>Back in the McFly house, Jennifer watches as Marty Sr takes a video call from a co-worker named Needles (Flea). Marty is unsure about being a part of Needles\\' illegal plan, but gives in when he\\'s called a chicken. A few moments later, Marty is shocked when his boss Mr Fujitsu (Jim Ishida) contacts him, claiming he was monitoring the call, and has Marty fired, causing a \"your\\'re fired\" message to be printed out on fax machines throughout the home (even one near Jennifer, who takes it).<br/><br/>Doc manages to find where Jennifer is hiding, and tells her to head out through the front door. She manages to make her way there, only to encounter her older self! The shock of seeing herself older, causes her to pass out, and Doc catches her before she falls.<br/><br/>After finding Marty nearby, Doc gets him to help carry Jennifer back to the DeLorean (which has just been returned by old Biff...who has painfully stumbled out of the vehicle, breaking the top of his cane off inside the car!). Doc the claims when they get back to 1985, he intends to destroy the time machine to prevent any further damage to the space-time continuum.<br/><br/>Once everyone is in the car, Doc sets the time circuits for October 26th, 1985, and they land near Jennifer\\'s home. Doc claims they\\'ll leave her on her family\\'s porch-swing, and Marty can come back later, to convince her that the 2015 adventure was just a dream. As they leave, Marty questions when Jennifer\\'s parents put bars on the front windows.<br/><br/>Doc then drives Marty back to the McFly\\'s residence, before driving the DeLorean back to his lab. Marty then sneaks in through his house\\'s rear window, but finds a girl (Nikki Birdsong) sleeping in his room. Her screams wake up her family, and Marty is chased out of the house by her father (Al White)!<br/><br/>Marty runs down the street, seeing the once-gentrified street in a state of disarray. Coming upon one house, he grabs the newspaper on the front-step, and is shocked to see that it is dated October 26th, 1985! Suddenly, he hears the cocking of a gun, and turns to find Mr Strickland(James Tolkan), brandishing a shotgun. Marty attempts to reason with the armed man claiming Strickland gave him detention last week. Strickland claims the school burned down 6 years ago, but the moment is interrupted by a drive-by shooting, and Marty rushes off into the night!<br/><br/>He eventually ends up at the Hill Valley Courthouse, which has been turned into Biff\\'s Pleasure Paradise and Casino! Marty soon finds himself watching a video at the steps of the nearby Biff Tannen Museum, that explains how Biff\\'s \\'fabulous winning streak\\' at sports gambling, caused him to gain local power, and influence those in higher office. When Marty finds out that Biff married his mother Lorraine, he freaks out, but is then subdued by Biff\\'s gang of Match (Billy Zane), 3D (Casey Siemaszko), and Skinhead (JJ Cohen).<br/><br/>Marty then wakes up on the 27th floor of the Pleasure Paradise, where he finds his Mom! Biff arrives shortly afterwards, claiming Marty is supposed to be at a boarding school in Switzerland. Lorraine attempts to stand-up to Biff and claim she\\'s leaving him, but when Biff threatens to financially cut off her kids and possibly jail them, she quiets down.<br/><br/>Once Biff leaves, Marty pleads to know where his father George McFly is. When Lorraine mentions \"Oak Park Cemetery,\" Marty rushes off into the night. In the darkness, he finds a tombstone, showing George\\'s death having been on March 15th, 1973. Suddenly, a shadow falls over the tombstone, and Marty turns to find Doc and the DeLorean.<br/><br/>They return to Doc\\'s garage, where he explains he went to the public library to find out more information. Given it was shut down, Doc \\'borrowed\\' some of the old newspaper records, and began piecing together what happened (as he mentions this, Marty finds the headline telling of his father\\'s murder in 1973, and tears it out of the library binding). Doc surmises that prior to the current date, something in the past caused the timeline they were on, to skew into the \"Alternate 1985\" they are currently in (while Marty, Doc, and Einstein find this timeline incorrect, everyone else finds it totally normal).<br/><br/>Doc also reveals that he found the receipt for the Sports Almanac in the DeLorean, along with the top of Old Biff\\'s cane. Doc surmises that Old Biff is the cause of this, and in showing Marty a picture of young Biff winning a big horse race bet in 1958, they can see the top of the sports almanac sticking out of his pocket! Marty figures they need to back to the future to stop old Biff, but Doc claims that will do no good, since the current timeline, would lead them into a future of their current reality, one in which Doc has been committed by local authorities. To repair the damage, they have to go into the past, but not before finding out where, when, and how young Biff got the sports almanac.<br/><br/>Marty then confronts Biff back at the casino. The fact that Marty knows about the almanac, leads Biff to tell Marty how on November 12th, 1955, he was picking up his car when an old man confronted him. It was then that Biff received the almanac, though he had no idea who the old man was, or believed his claim to be \"a distant relative.\"<br/><br/>Biff then shows Marty the almanac, before putting it back in his safe. While his back is turned, Marty purloins a casino matchbook from a nearby tray. As Biff turns back, he tells Marty that the old man claimed that \"a crazy wild-eyed scientist or a kid may show up asking about that book,\" and then pulls out a small pistol!<br/><br/>Marty manages to distract Biff, but barely escapes as the madman attempts to kill him! Marty rushes onto the hotel roof, where he is cornered. Marty claims that if Biff kills him, they can match the bullet to his gun, but Biff claims he owns the police...who couldn\\'t match up the bullet that killed George McFly.<br/><br/>Biff is surprised when Marty falls over the edge of the roof, but as he goes to examine the body, Biff finds Marty has landed on the hood of the DeLorean, before Doc knocks Biff out by opening the driver\\'s side door!<br/><br/>Marty and Biff then set the time circuits to November 12th, 1955, though there is a moment of worry when the time circuits begin flashing January 1st, 1885. Doc manages to fix this temporarily, but as they head back to 1955, Marty notes that they are leaving Jennifer and Einstein behind. However, Doc claims that \"assuming\" they succeed in their mission, the changes they make will affect the present timeline, and both Jennifer and Einstein will be fine.<br/><br/>Once back in 1955, Doc hides the DeLorean behind the Lyon Estates advertisement outside the town. Giving Marty some binoculars, a walkie-talkie and some money, Doc tells Marty that he has to find young Biff and tail him, but not to interfere with old Biff giving his younger self the almanac (old Biff still needs to bring the DeLorean he\\'s stolen back to the future). Doc also cautions Marty to be careful to not run into his \\'other self,\\' since Marty\\'s other self is going to be at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance tonight, and the 1955 Doc will be prepping for the clocktower lightning strike.<br/><br/>Marty manages to get some 50\\'s clothing, and tails young Biff to the Western Auto store near the Courthouse. As young Biff haggles over the $300 price of cleaning his car, Marty hides in the backseat. From there he witnesses Biff harassing Lorraine, before she and her friend run off.<br/><br/>It is then that young Biff finds an old man sitting in his car...and is even more surprised when the old man manages to get the car to start!<br/><br/>Old Biff drives his younger self back to his Grandma\\'s house, where he attempts to give himself the almanac, but young Biff just thinks the old man is playing a joke on him. Old Biff then turns on the radio, and his younger self is surprised when the almanac predicts the final score of the football game they\\'re listening to! Young Biff then takes the almanac, and he and the old man leave the garage, locking the door and trapping Marty inside! Marty radios to Doc to get him out, but Doc claims he has to find another method to do so, since he can\\'t take the time machine out in the daylight.<br/><br/>Marty is stuck in the garage until nightfall, when young Biff opens the garage doors, and heads off to the dance. Just as Biff leaves, Doc peddles up on a bicycle into the Tannen\\'s driveway, where he finds the garage empty.<br/><br/>As Doc peddles through town, his walkie-talkie goes off, and Marty explains he\\'s on his way to the dance. As Doc cautions him to watch out for his \\'other-self,\\' Doc himself has to deal with the same when his 1955 counterpart asks for a wrench from a nearby toolbox. Doc hand off the wrench, while keeping his identity hidden from his past-self.<br/><br/>Once Biff arrives at Hill Valley High School, he takes the almanac with him, and Marty trails him into the school auditorium. As he observes Biff and his gang spiking the punch and looking at a girly magazine called \"Ooh-la-la,\" he watches as Mr Strickland notices the gang, who then beat a hasty retreat outside.<br/><br/>While Biff sends his gang to find \"Calvin Klein\" (aka the 1955 Marty), Biff reads through the girly magazine, Marty attempts to get the almanac from his back pocket when Strickland shows up, and confiscates it!<br/><br/>Marty trails Strickland to his office, and once the school administrator takes a drink of liquor, he tosses the magazine in the office trash can and leaves! Marty rushes for the book, but finds the girly magazine, with the almanac\\'s cover on it! Panicking over what to do next, Marty notices out the window that his father is confronting Biff in the parking lot.<br/><br/>Marty rushes out, and once his other-self, Lorraine, and George have left the scene, swoops in and recovers the almanac from Biff! Marty radios to Doc that he\\'s got the book, but not before Biff\\'s gang finds Marty, and give chase.<br/><br/>Doc meanwhile, attempts to fly off to the school, but the DeLorean hits the billboard, causing the time circuits to malfunction temporarily, and trailing a length of advertising pennants from the sign.<br/><br/>Back at the school, Marty has managed to evade Biff\\'s gang, but as they come into the auditorium and see Marty\\'s past-self onstage, they head to the side, attempting to take him out once he finishes playing the song \"Johnny B Goode!\" Marty hatches a plan that ends up knocking the thugs out, preventing a major paradox with his past self. Radioing to Doc that everything is fine, Doc tells Marty he\\'ll be landing on the school roof soon.<br/><br/>Rushing outside just as his past-self meets Lorraine and George, Marty then encounters Biff who wants to fight. Marty declines, but when Biff calls him a chicken, Marty is ready to go...until his past-self throws open the nearby door, running off as he knocks Marty to the ground! This causes the almanac to be revealed inside Marty\\'s jacket, leading Biff to angrily kick Marty hard, before rushing to his car, and driving off!<br/><br/>Marty rushes to the roof and tells Doc what happened. They then head towards the River Road Tunnel, trailing Biff. As Doc lowers the DeLorean, Marty uses the hoverboard from 2015, to get closer to Biff\\'s car. Just as he\\'s about to recover the book, Biff notices him! Biff attempts to make Marty let go, but the determined teenager hangs on. As they approach the River Road Tunnel, Biff attempts to crush Marty against the wall.<br/><br/>Marty manages to avoid this, and makes another attempt for the book. Biff barely manages to avoid hitting a truck, before attempting to squash Marty against the tunnel\\'s other wall, before Marty recovers the almanac!<br/><br/>However, as Marty attempts to return back the way he came, Biff turns his vehicle around, and barrels on towards Marty, attempting to run him over. Marty just barely makes it to the tunnel entrance, when a string of pennants falls from the sky, and he grabs on...being hoisted aloft by Doc in the DeLorean!<br/><br/>As Biff looks skyward, he is distracted and barrels into the back of the truck he almost hit in the tunnel: an A Jones manure truck, that once again ends up coating him and his car in the foul-smelling stuff!<br/><br/>Doc flies Marty back to the Lyon Estates area. While Marty is able to settle down on the ground, Doc tries to maneuver around in the high winds and flashes of lighting as the thunderstorm begins to roll in. Doc tells Marty over the walkie-talkie to burn the almanac. Marty places the book in an old bucket, and using the book of matches from Biff\\'s casino, sets it aflame. As he looks at the matchbook, Maraty notices the words \"Pleasure Paradise,\" become the words \"Auto Detailing!\" Pulling out the newspaper that says \"George McFly Murdered,\" Marty is ecstatic as the headline becomes, \"George McFly Honored.\"<br/><br/>Marty radios to Doc about the changes, and Doc looks at the newspaper headline he has, showing that instead of being \"committed,\" he is being \"commended!\"<br/><br/>With the future fixed, Doc prepares to retrieve Marty, when a bolt of lightning almost hits the DeLorean, but strikes a nearby tree! As Doc attempts to recover, a series of lightning bolts strike the DeLorean, that then disappears from the sky! As Marty attempts to radio Doc, the pennants he used fall to the ground, before the storm brings the rain.<br/><br/>Suddenly, a car pulls up behind Marty, and a man gets out, asking if he is speaking to \"Marty McFly.\" When Marty affirms, the man claims he\\'s from Western Union, and presents Marty with a letter that was given to the local office, 70 years ago.<br/><br/>Marty opens it up, and finds it is a letter from Doc Brown, dated September 1st, 1885! Knowing there\\'s only one man who can help him, Marty rushes off towards the town square.<br/><br/>Arriving minutes after his past-self went back to the future, Marty confronts 1955 Doc, who faints upon seeing another Marty in his presence!</div></div>'}\n",

They split the universe into 3,600 sectors, with one Green Lantern per sector. One such Green Lantern, Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) of Sector 2814, defeated the fear-essence being Parallax (voiced by Clancy Brown) and imprisoned him in the Lost Sector on the ruined planet Ryut. However, in the present day, Parallax escapes from his prison. Six months later, after killing four Green Lanterns and destroying two planets, Parallax attacks Sector 2814 and mortally wounds Abin Sur, who escapes and crash-lands on Earth. The dying Abin Sur commands his ring to find a worthy successor on the planet.<br/><br/>Ferris Aircraft test pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is chosen by the ring and transported to the crash site, where Abin Sur appoints him a Green Lantern, by telling him to take the lantern and speak the oath. At home he says the oath of the Green Lanterns while under trance from the glow of the lantern. After he\\'s attacked while leaving a bar Jordan swings to punch one of his attackers, letting out a huge fist of green energy. Afterward, Jordan is whisked away to the Green Lantern Corps home planet of Oa, where he meets and trains with Tomar-Re (voiced by Geoffrey Rush) and Kilowog (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan). He encounters Corps leader Sinestro (Mark Strong), who is not pleased that a human which is primitive compared to other species has become a Green Lantern. With Sinestro seeing him as unfit and fearful, Jordan quits and returns to Earth, keeping the power ring and lantern.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, after being summoned by his father Senator Robert Hammond (Tim Robbins) to a secret government facility, scientist Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) performs an autopsy on Abin Sur\\'s body. A piece of Parallax inside the corpse inserts itself inside Hammond, mutating the scientist and giving him telepathy and telekinetic powers, at the cost of his sanity. After discovering that he was only chosen due to his father\\'s influence, Hammond resentfully attempts to kill his father by telekinetically sabotaging his helicopter at a party. However, Jordan uses his ring to save the senator and the party guests, including his childhood sweetheart, Ferris manager and fellow test pilot Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), who later recognizes Jordan under the suit and mask. Shortly afterward, Jordan encounters Hammond, who succeeds in his second attempt to kill his father by burning him alive. Both Jordan and Hammond realize Parallax is on his way to Earth.<br/><br/>Back on Oa, the Guardians tell Sinestro that Parallax was once one of their own, until he desired to control the yellow essence of fear, only to become the embodiment of fear itself. Believing the only means to fight fear is by fear itself, Sinestro requests for the Guardians to forge a ring of the same yellow power, preparing to concede Earth\\'s destruction to Parallax in order to protect Oa. However, Jordan appears and tells Sinestro not to use the yellow ring and for the Corps to help him protect his planet from Parallax\\'s imminent invasion. They deny his request, but allow Jordan to return and protect his home planet.<br/><br/>Upon returning to Earth, Jordan saves Ferris from being injected with Parallax\\'s essence by Hammond. Parallax then arrives, consuming Hector\\'s life force for failing to kill Jordan, and then wreaking havoc on Coast City. Jordan arrives to do battle with the monster, even drawing strength from his new calling\\'s oath to face the foe. Having gained his enemy\\'s full attention, Jordan lures Parallax away from Earth and toward the Sun, using the Sun\\'s gravity to pull and disintegrate the entity. <br/><br/>He loses consciousness after the battle, but is saved by Sinestro, Kilowog, and Tomar-Re. Later the entire Green Lantern Corps congratulates him for his bravery. Sinestro tells Jordan he now bears the responsibility of protecting his sector as a Green Lantern. Sometime later when he is alone, Sinestro, still in possession of the yellow ring, places it on his finger, causing his green suit to change to yellow along with his eyes.</div></div>'}\n",

Twenty-eight years later, the initial welcome by the human population has faded. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new \\'Prawn\\' friends.<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=Kenneth%20Chisholm%20(kchishol%40rogers.com)&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_2\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">The film opens with a documentary-style series of interviews that introduce the story: twenty years prior, an alien ship arrives above Johannesburg, South Africa. It hovers above the city for three months without any contact; eventually humans take the initiative and cut into the ship. They discover a large group of aliens who are malnourished and sick. The aliens are later assessed as being \"workers\", with their leadership mysteriously missing (it is hypothesized that a plague may have wiped out all of the leadership-caste). Grainy footage shows part of the ship (supposedly a command module) falling to Earth, but nobody has been able to find it, leaving the ship still hovering but inoperable.<br/><br/>The creatures are given permission to leave their craft and live on Earth but are housed in a squalid government camp consisting mostly of dilapidated one to two room shacks. The alien race\\'s true name is never learned; they are primarily referred to as \"prawns\", a derogatory term referring to the bottom-feeding sea creature they resemble or, more rarely, \"non-humans\". Overcrowding and militarization eventually turn the area into a slum known as District 9. A massive black market is set up between the aliens and a group of Nigerians primarily led by Mumbo, a paraplegic warlord. In addition to inter-species prostitution, the Nigerians exchange canned cat food for alien weapons, of which the cat food has an effect similar to catnip on the aliens.<br/><br/>The present story takes place in 2010. Patience over the alien situation among the human population of Johannesburg has run out and control over them has been contracted to Multi-National United (MNU), a private company that shows little regard for the aliens\\' welfare. MNU\\'s actual agenda is their interest in the aliens\\' advanced weaponry, but its integration with alien biology makes it useless to humans.<br/><br/>An MNU field operative named Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is tasked with moving 1.8 million aliens to a new camp, District 10, located 240 km from Johannesburg, with help from private security forces working for MNU. MNU teams serving warrants for the relocation of the aliens find caches of contraband items, including weapons, in many alien shacks. Wikus himself oversees several inspections and is assisted by Koobus Venter, a belligerent MNU military operative whose tactics with the aliens are ruthless and cruel. In another shack, not far away, an alien named Christopher distills a mysterious black substance that has taken him 20 years to find the components for and stores it in a small black cylinder. While serving and eviction notice to Christopher, and searching his shack, Wikus finds the cylinder which squirts its contents into his face. He becomes almost instantly nauseous and collects the device as evidence.<br/><br/>Wikus returns to his office and grows increasingly ill throughout the day, the side-effects of the black fluid becoming more prominent. He returns home that evening and collapses at a surprise party in his house. He is rushed to a hospital where a doctor discovers his left arm has metamorphosed into that of a prawn\\'s. Wikus is then taken into custody by MNU, the cylinder is confiscated, and a series of tests and experiments are performed on him. Most surprising to those studying him, is that his DNA has been altered to the point, that he can operate the alien\\'s weapons with both his alien hand, and human hand. The scientists discover that his DNA is currently \"in balance\" with the alien DNA, which is gradually transforming him completely into a prawn. With the permission of Wikus\\' ruthless father-in-law, they decide to harvest his body for biological material at this critical point, to see if they can figure out how to get the same reaction in other human subjects later on.<br/><br/>However, during the attempted vivisection, Wikus overpowers his captors and escapes, fleeing from MNU. Attempting to return home, he finds MNU agents already there. Making his way across the city, he is shocked when an all-points bulletin is put out for his capture, with doctored footage showing him having \"interacted\" with the aliens in an unsavory way. With nowhere else to turn to, Wikus finds refuge in District 9.<br/><br/>Wikus returns to Christopher\\'s run-down shack where he finds the alien\\'s small son. It is hinted that Christopher might be a surviving member of the prawn leadership caste, as he shows much more knowledge of how alien technology works, possesses or at least found the command module, and interacts with MNU officials more articulately than other aliens.<br/><br/>Looking around inside, it, Wikus is shocked to find that hidden under the shack, is the mother ship\\'s command module. Christopher explains to Wikus that the cylinder he took, was the power source that could power the module to return to the ship...where the prawn explains there would be technology to reverse the man\\'s current mutation!<br/><br/>In order to get the cylinder back from MNU, Wikus steals some alien weaponry from Mumbo and his gang, with Mumbo vowing to capture Wikus and eat his mutated arm (his witch doctor believes this will give him the power to operate the alien weaponry). With Christopher\\'s help they launch an assault on MNU and successfully retrieve the fuel cylinder. While there, Christopher discovers that MNU has been conducting horrific experiments on his people, before he and Wikus fight their way back to District 9.<br/><br/>However, after seeing what the humans are doing to his race, Christopher\\'s priorities have changed, with him claiming that Wikus\\' cure will take three years, while he (Christopher) attempts to find a way to seek help for the other Prawns in Johannesburg. Furious, Wikus knocks Christopher unconscious and powers up the ship himself. The MNU mercenaries target Wikus and destroy one of the command module\\'s engines, causing it to crash land inside District 9.<br/><br/>After Wikus is captured by MNU, a battle between the MNU mercenaries and Mumbo\\'s gang breaks out. After a protracted firefight, the Nigerians capture Wikus. Just before Wikus\\' arm is chopped off, Christopher\\'s son (using the command module controls) activates several systems in the mothership, including the autopilot routine of a mechanized battle suit; it slaughters Mumbo and his men after they fire on it. Wikus enters the alien walker battle suit, and after initially attempting to flee, returns and rescues Christopher. Armed with a lightning cannon, tracking missiles, and a high-powered machine gun, Wikus begins to fight the MNU men. After being knocked over by an anti-tank sniper round, he convinces Christopher to return to the shuttle without him, over Christopher\\'s objections. Christopher promises Wikus that he will return in three years to repair his body. Christopher then boards the shuttle and activates a tractor beam which returns the command module to the mother ship. The mother ship powers up with a loud, rolling boom and flies off. On TV, humans cheer as the ship leaves Earth.<br/><br/>Wikus\\' battle suit is hit in the back and the suit ejects him. Wikus, heavily wounded, begins dragging himself away from Koobus Venter, the sole survivor of an MNU squad, but is quickly caught. As he prepares to shoot Wikus, other prawns appear, attacking and dismembering Venter.<br/><br/>The film concludes with another series of interviews and news broadcasts, providing human opinions on the events that unfolded. The aliens are successfully moved to District 10, which now has a population of 2.5 million and is growing. One of Wikus\\' coworkers hacks MNU\\'s database and publicly exposes their illegal genetic experiments. There are many differing theories on Wikus\\' fate. Some people believe that he either left on the mother ship, is in hiding, was captured by MNU or a government agency. Some interviewees hypothesize that the aliens are planning to return with a full army and declare war on humanity. An interview with Wikus\\' wife reveals a small metal rose was left on her doorstep (Wikus has earlier demonstrated his affection for his wife with similar handmade gifts). Her friends have told her that it could not have possibly been Wikus, but she appears unsure.<br/><br/>In the final scene, an alien with a bandaged left arm is shown in a junk yard, fashioning a rose out of scrap metal.</div></div>'}\n",

However, little does Bolt know he is actually just a star on a hit television series called Bolt. To gain a more realistic performance, the TV show\\'s producers have deceived Bolt his entire life, arranging the filming in such a way that Bolt believes the television show is real and he really has superpowers. After filming completes for the latest episode, Bolt escapes from his on-set trailer when he mistakenly believes Penny has been kidnapped by the television villain. He attempts to break through a window, knocking himself unconscious and falls into a box of styrofoam peanuts. With no one aware Bolt is in the box, it is shipped from Hollywood to New York City. In New York, he meets Mittens, a female alley cat who bullies pigeons out of their food. Bolt, convinced Mittens is an evil nemesis who works for Doctor Calico, forces Mittens to help him get back to Hollywood, and the two start their journey westward on a truck. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Penny is deeply saddened over Bolt\\'s disappearance but is forced by the studio to continue filming with a Bolt lookalike. As their adventure proceeds, Bolt starts to notice that his superpowers aren\\'t working, and rationalizes this is the effect that styrofoam has on his body.<br/><br/>Surprised at his first feelings of both pain and hunger, Bolt is shown by Mittens how to act like a cute, but needy dog, and is rewarded by food. They meet Rhino, a fearless, TV-obsessed hamster and huge Bolt fan who joins their team. Mittens tries to convince Bolt that his superpowers aren\\'t real, but their discussion is cut short by the arrival of Animal Control, who captures them both and transports them to an animal shelter. After being freed en route by Rhino, Bolt finally realizes that he is just a normal dog, but regains his confidence after Rhino (oblivious to this revelation) gives him a pep talk. They rescue Mittens from the shelter and escape, allowing them to continue their journey. Along the way, Bolt learns to enjoy typical dog activities (such as hanging his head out the window and playing fetch), but Mittens refuses to go farther than Las Vegas. She tells Bolt that his Hollywood life is fake and there is no real love for him there. Her emotional rant reveals that she was once a house cat, but was abandoned by her previous owner and left to brave the harsh streets alone and declawed. Bolt refuses to believe that Penny doesn\\'t love him, and continues on alone, wishing Mittens the best. Rhino, learning of Bolt\\'s departure, convinces Mittens that they must help him, and the two set off to find Bolt once again.<br/><br/>Bolt reaches the studio, finding Penny embracing his lookalike. Unaware that Penny still misses him, and that her affection for the lookalike was only a part of a rehearsal for the show, he leaves brokenhearted. Mittens, on a gantry in the studio, sees what Bolt does not - Penny telling her mother how much she misses Bolt. Realizing that Penny truly does love Bolt, Mittens follows Bolt and explains. At the same time, the Bolt-lookalike panics during filming and accidentally knocks over some torches, setting the sound stage on fire and trapping Penny. Bolt arrives and reunites with Penny inside the burning studio, being rescued as they succumb to smoke asphyxiation.<br/><br/>Penny and her mother subsequently quit the show when their agent attempts to exploit the incident for publicity purposes. Penny herself adopts Mittens and Rhino, and moves to a rural home to enjoy a simpler, happy lifestyle with Bolt and her new pets. The show continues, but with Bolt\\'s original replacement and a new replacement for \"Penny\" with her appearance being explained in the show as being serious injuries necessitating her undergoing facial reconstruction surgery, and adopting an alien abduction storyline (one that even Rhino finds unrealistic, and Bolt finds \"redonkulous\").</div></div>'}\n",

A man fitted with a magnetic collar runs through a forest trying to escape a large spinning saw blade flying through the air. The saw blade eventually catches the man and decapitates him. From the decapitated man\\'s perspective, we see another man in a Confederate Army general\\'s uniform seize the saw blade, which is engraved with a large emblem of a tarantula.<br/><br/>In a town called Morgan, West Virginia, Army Captain James West (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000226/?ref_=ttpl\">Will Smith</a>), hides out in a half-filled water tower. While he has a romantic evening with a beautiful woman named Belle (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0004731/?ref_=ttpl\">Garcelle Beauvais</a>), he sees a small unit of Confederate soldiers arrive and load up a wagon with boxes of nitroglycerin. West remarks that he\\'d been waiting for the men for a week and that they\\'re under the command of General \"Bloodbath\" McGrath, the man who\\'d retrieved the saw blade. The horses attached to the wagon become jumpy and cause the wagon to weaken the already rickety water tower, spilling West, naked, into the storehouse where the men are taking the nitro. West battles with them briefly, retrieves his clothes and jumps onto the wagon (which has no driver now). He finally takes control of the wagon, which almost goes over a cliff overlooking a saloon called Fat-Can-Candy\\'s, or Fat-Can\\'s. West sees that McGrath is in Fat-Can\\'s.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the saloon, McGrath (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0505971/?ref_=ttpl\">Ted Levine</a>) draws the attention of two burlesque performers. One of them, Rita Escobar (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000161/?ref_=ttpl\">Salma Hayek</a>), is pushed aside by Artemis Gordon (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000177/?ref_=ttpl\">Kevin Kline</a>), who wears a drag disguise. After Gordon sings \"Sons of the South\" for McGrath and his men, McGrath drags him upstairs. They pass a room where a bundle obviously containing a struggling man is being tended to by McGrath\\'s men and into an empty bedroom. McGrath wears a trumpet style hearing aid because he lost his ear at Chickamauga. Gordon hypnotizes McGrath with a belt buckle equipped with two swirling wheels and begins to question him about missing scientists, including Dr. Escobar. McGrath responds like a dog until the wheels begin to fail and his hypnosis is broken. At that moment, West bursts in through the window and punches McGrath, who falls stunned to the floor. West tries to dismiss Gordon, saying he\\'s going to execute McGrath. McGrath wakes up and charges West, knocking them through the wall and into the next room. McGrath then runs out of the room, joining his men carrying the bundle.<br/><br/>West and Gordon get in each other\\'s way trying to apprehend McGrath, so McGrath and his men escape with the scientist. West identifies himself as being with the U.S. Army, while Gordon identifies himself as a U.S. Marshal. While West and Gordon argue about who has the authority to arrest McGrath, in a nearby carriage, Dr. Arliss Loveless (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000110/?ref_=ttpl\">Kenneth Branagh</a>) watches the scene, while his assistant, Miss Lippenrieder (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0256998/?ref_=ttpl\">Sofia Eng</a>), reads their lips. Loveless releases the wagon carrying the nitro, letting it roll down the hill, directly into the saloon, where it explodes.<br/><br/>West rides to the White House a few days later and meets with President Ulysses S. Grant (Gordon in disguise) in the Oval Office. West reports that his efforts to arrest McGrath were thwarted by another agent, Gordon. Grant begins to praise the talents of Gordon when West draws his revolver and points it at him, calling him an impostor. Gordon insists that he is the president and West shoots at the ceiling of the room. Gordon admits that he\\'d been posing as Grant; West tells him that he noticed Gordon\\'s Harvard class ring, which should have been a West Point emblem. The real Grant (also <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000177/?ref_=ttpl\">Kevin Kline</a>) enters the office and tells the two they\\'ll be working together on a new mission for him. Grant shows them his intelligence room, where he states that the nation\\'s top scientists in physics, hydraulics, and explosives have been kidnapped by McGrath, and that West and Gordon have been working on the same case. Grant shows them a note that tells them that an unidentified despot is using the kidnapped scientists to develop a new weapons system far more advanced than any in existence. The conditions are the surrender of the United States government within one week. The note came with a cake of the White House infested with tarantulas, apparently from McGrath. Grant gives West and Gordon one week to track down the mysterious enemy.<br/><br/>The two travel in a specially equipped train, the Wanderer. On the way, Gordon makes use of the head of the man killed by the giant saw blade, Dr. Thaddeus Morton (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0801351/?ref_=ttpl\">Michael Sims</a>), whose retinas are imprinted with the last image he saw, General McGrath. The image also shows that in McGrath\\'s coat pocket is an invitation to a costume ball in the Garden District of New Orleans. When they arrive in New Orleans, the two have a brief argument about how to infiltrate the ball undetected. West chooses to simply dress like he always does and sneak in. Gordon opts for the costume of a Russian frontiersman.<br/><br/>At the ball, West watches McGrath from a distance upstairs. West fools Dr. Loveless\\'s personal assistant Mae Lee East (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000499/?ref_=ttpl\">Bai Ling</a>), who thinks his uniform is a costume. When the party officially begins, a large papier-mâché head of Abraham Lincoln is brought out and explodes. Arliss Loveless emerges in a steam-powered wheelchair and announces his return after a horrible accident involving explosives that claimed his legs and most of his internal organs. Arliss is throwing the party for foreign dignitaries that have funded his operations. Loveless sees West at the party, knowing he wasn\\'t invited and the two banter in masked racial and \"short\" epithets. Loveless also tells West that he hasn\\'t had any recent contact with General McGrath. Moments later, Loveless takes McGrath to his study and tells him to meet him at Malheureux Point on a nearby lake, where he\\'ll equip McGrath with a cache of new weaponry for him and his men. West, who had been listening to them outside the room, is able to determine the meeting location but Miss East discovers him there. She tries to seduce West long enough for a man hiding in a mural behind him to kill him. West dodges, causing the man to miss and kill Miss East instead. West opens fire on every other mural in the room, killing several would-be assassins also hiding in the paintings.<br/><br/>In the ballroom, West dances with a woman who he assumes to be Gordon in disguise and tells her that he\\'s going to the meeting point given to McGrath. When West touches her supposed fake breasts, Gordon encourages the crowd to hang him, even throwing them a rope. Gordon steals into another room of the mansion and finds Rita Escobar in a giant cage, and tells her that he\\'s looking for missing scientists. She tells him that Loveless has them working in his dungeon. Gordon frees her and tells her that the dungeon has been cleared of its captives. Outside, West tries to talk his way out of a lynching. When Gordon and Rita roll by in a wagon, West uses the rope (made of rubber), to launch himself onto the wagon. Rita explains to West and Gordon that she\\'s not really an entertainer, but is looking for her father Guillermo Escobar, a scientist. West detaches one of the horses and rides off to Malheureux Point.<br/><br/>On an ironclad floating on the lake, McGrath speaks with Loveless and the foreign dignitaries from the ball. McGrath\\'s men have assembled on the shore of the lake and are waiting for their leader when a heavily armed iron tank rolls out of the water and stops in the middle of the crowd. It opens fire with Gatling guns, flamethrowers and cannons, rotating 180 degrees and killing all of McGrath\\'s men. From the warship, McGrath accuses Loveless of betrayal, but Loveless counters that McGrath and General Lee betrayed him when they surrendered; Loveless also tells McGrath that he is testing the effectiveness of the weapon the kidnapped scientists developed, and tells his assistants to check the timing of reloads and deaths and to calibrate the deadly machine. McGrath orders Loveless to stop at gunpoint, but Loveless shoots him with a gun hidden in his wheelchair and orders his body thrown overboard. He addresses his foreign benefactors, telling them that if they\\'re interested in purchasing the weapons technology he\\'s demonstrated, which he calls \"mechanology\" that they should meet him in his Utah retreat, Spider Canyon.<br/><br/>On the lake shore, West, Gordon, and Rita find McGrath\\'s slaughtered men lie slaughtered. Gordon and Rita wonder what could have killed all the men and West relates a story he\\'d heard about a large, armored vehicle that killed all the residents of a freed slave community called New Liberty in Illinois. McGrath, mortally wounded, somehow made it to shore and tells West that Loveless is responsible for the deaths of his men and the people of New Liberty. He dies before he can tell West where Loveless has gone. Rita says that she\\'d overheard some of Loveless\\'s women talking about the desert and a place called \"OO-tah\", which Gordon and West recognize as \"Utah.\" They make Coleman (the Wanderer\\'s engineer) take them there immediately. They decide to leave Rita behind due to the danger, but she gets inside the train anyway by using the train\\'s gadgets. Rita tells West and Gordon that she overhead the foreign dignitaries discussing the Louisiana Purchase and Queen Isabella. She also flirts with West, Gordon, and Coleman. The men decide to take her along, despite the distraction she might create.<br/><br/>The Wanderer catches up to Loveless\\'s train, but they lose the scientist when they pass through a tunnel. Loveless\\'s train, equipped with huge hydraulic spider\\'s legs, had been able to hide while the Wanderer passed it. Loveless\\'s train then follows the Wanderer and opens fire on it. West tries to make use of \"The Egressor\" (a small rail-cart) that will allow him to board Loveless\\'s train, but the cable attaching it breaks and he has to use Gordon\\'s rubber rope. When one of Loveless\\'s men attacks West, he uses a blade Gordon built into his shoe to kill the man. He stuffs the man\\'s body in the train\\'s smokestack, disabling it. Meanwhile, Loveless has stopped the Wanderer with a giant grappling missile. When West boards the Wanderer, Rita assumes it\\'s Loveless and knocks all three of them out with Gordon\\'s sleeping gas billiard ball.<br/><br/>With his own train wrecked by West, Loveless commandeers the Wanderer and takes them prisoner, and takes Rita for himself. Loveless outfits Gordon and West with the same collars as Dr. Morton and places them in a wire-fenced patch of ground near a cornfield. Loveless takes the Wanderer and rides off, telling them he\\'ll be at Spider Canyon and later at Promontory Point, Utah. Gordon finds a note in his pocket saying that the wired area is Loveless\\'s experimental prison camp for \"political dissidents\" and that if they remain within the wire, they\\'ll live. West foolhardily steps outside the barrier and the magnetic collar on his neck activates a nearby machine, which throws two giant saw blades at them. The blades are attracted to powerful magnets in the collars and both are force to run. They\\'re finally able to force the saw blades to collide when they jump into a nearby crevice of muck. After several mishaps with the magnetic collars, Gordon sees his toolkit floating in the water, which he remembers he had in his pocket the entire time and removes the magnetic collars.<br/><br/>The two begin a long hike to Spider Canyon. While camping in the desert at night, Gordon notices that West is skilled enough to live in the desert. West explains that he\\'d become a fugitive slave when he was a boy and was raised by Native Americans. Gordon notices a tarantula on West\\'s hand, and he lets it go. A desert wasp promptly attacks the spider, and West tells Gordon the wasp will kill the spider and use the carcass to house its eggs. West tells Gordon that he saw his parents again at the camp at New Liberty. Gordon pledges to help West get Loveless.<br/><br/>As the two continue on, Gordon carries one of the magnetic collars because he thinks the high-powered magnet could be useful. The collar suddenly pulls him to the right and stops when it connects to a buried set of railroad tracks. The rail line leads directly to Spider Canyon where they find the Wanderer. In the canyon below, they see Loveless\\'s private fortress. Moments later, Loveless appears driving an 80-foot tall mechanical tarantula, fully armored and powered by coal and hydraulics. When a large group of rock columns block it from moving, the contraption shoots giant fireballs, destroying the rocks.<br/><br/>Gordon and West load up using the Wanderer\\'s arsenal and ride on horseback after Loveless. Loveless rides his machine to Promontory Point where President Grant attends the spike driving ceremony marking the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad. Loveless demands the unconditional surrender of the nation to the \"Loveless Alliance\". Grant refuses, prompting Loveless to use his fire cannon to destroy Grant\\'s train. Suddenly, another Grant (Gordon in disguise) appears and tells Loveless that the real Grant is an impostor and tries to dismiss him. Meanwhile, West has scaled one of the spider\\'s legs, but Loveless\\'s woman Munitia shoots him and he drops off. Loveless takes both Gordon and Grant prisoner and he returns to his fortress. West wakes up later, alive because he was wearing Gordon\\'s chain-mail vest that stopped the bullet.<br/><br/>At the fortress, Loveless announces to his foreign allies that the United States will be divided up among them and himself, with Spain, Great Britain, Mexico, and France having their former territorial claims to the continent restored. Meanwhile, West returns to the Wanderer and finds it stripped of all its weapons. The only gun left is a single-shot Derringer hidden in a belt buckle. Loveless orders the execution of Gordon when Grant refuses to sign the surrender. An exotic dancing girl, West in drag, appears and begins to tempt Loveless. West passes the tiny pistol to Gordon and activates a flamethrower built into the dress. Loveless orders West killed and he escapes to his mechanical spider with the president. West then rolls an incendiary 8-ball at Loveless\\'s men, and Rita and her father are able to escape.<br/><br/>Gordon and West regroup and, inspired by Da Vinci\\'s flying machine and the desert wasp, formulate a plan to attack the spider using a mechanical bicycle outfitted with wings. Coleman tells them he is a U.S. Marshal and gives them firebombs made from gunpowder, nitroglycerin, and 44-caliber primers. Though the contraption seems destined to fail, it works when Gordon pilots it off a cliff to gain more speed and achieve lift. Loveless again asks Grant to sign the surrender, but destroys a town with the mechanical spider when Grant refuses. Gordon and West fly to the spider and begin to drop the bombs on it. Munitia, firing a Gatling gun, shoots them out of the sky and they crash land on deck of the spider. Loveless\\'s women take them to Loveless, where he offers them a deal to join his alliance. West refuses, so Loveless drops him to the engine room through a trap door. West battles hand-to-hand with several of Loveless\\'s henchmen and defeats them, drawing Loveless to the engine room. West kicks Loveless and disables his wheelchair. Loveless reveals a set of mechanical spider legs underneath his wheelchair and pummels West and pins him to the floor. Gordon disarms and defeats Loveless\\'s women on the upper deck, then shoots the small Derringer at Loveless. Gordon\\'s shot hits one of the hydraulic lines of his mechanical legs, causing Loveless to sink to the floor. Loveless climbs back into his wheelchair and shoots at West with a double-barreled pistol built into the wheelchair. West dodges, and the shot hits the steam pipes. The giant tarantula loses power and goes over a cliff, catching a rock outcropping that stops it on the edge. The impact throws West and Loveless out the front and they dangle from a chain above a deep canyon. After challenging West for being \"yellow\" and a \"boy\", West pulls the lever on Loveless\\'s wheelchair and the two men plummet. West catches the end of the chain and Loveless falls into the canyon.<br/><br/>Back at Promontory Point, Grant tells West and Gordon that he\\'s forming a new government presidential protection service called the Secret Service. West and Gordon are agents One and Two. He also takes the Wanderer to return to Washington, leaving West to use Loveless\\'s spider. Rita reveals that Professor Escobar is not her father, but is her husband. West and Gordon ride the spider into the sun.</div></div>'}\n",

While Juni applies wart killer to his fingers, Carmen requests to hear the bedtime story, \"The Two Spies Who Fell in Love\".<br/><br/>Long ago, at a time of unstable relations between countries, a new breed of soldiers was created: super spies. Using their vast intellects and prowess in the art of stealth, they could stop wars before they even happened. The two protagonists of the story, both of whom were spies, were tasked with eliminating each other, but they ended up becoming infatuated with one another instead and soon fell in love. Despite being from opposing nations, they decided to marry, but this only painted a massive target on their backs for enemy factions that wished to see them dead. They ultimately chose to retire and start a family. Though unknown to the kids at this time, it\\'s shown to the audience that Ingrid and her husband, Gregorio (Antonio Banderas), are the spies in the story and that these events truly occurred. Ingrid then says goodnight to her children. Carmen comments that the story needs a new ending, while Juni suggests the addition of monsters.<br/><br/>Later in their bedroom, Gregorio and Ingrid, now consultants secretly working for the OSS (Organization of Super Spies), talk about how Carmen and Juni, according to their school principal, have been keeping secrets from them; Carmen\\'s been skipping out on school and Juni\\'s self-proclaimed \\'friends\\' are only in his head. Ingrid believes she and Gregorio are to blame due to them keeping their previous life secret, but he assures her it\\'s for the best -- he fears that if they ever told the kids, it would plant \\'visions of danger\\' in their minds should they ever leave them alone. During their conversation, Gregorio receives information from the OSS that several of their agents have gone missing, notifying Ingrid the following morning.<br/><br/>While driving Carmen and Juni to school, Gregorio nags Juni for being so attached to the children\\'s show, \"Floop\\'s Fooglies,\" created by quirky inventor and visionary Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming), but takes notice that one of Floop\\'s side characters, called \\'Fooglies,\\' looks suspiciously like one of the missing OSS agents, Donnagon Giggles (Mike Judge). While dropping off the kids, Gregorio tries to build confidence in Juni by telling him that if anyone bothers him, that he should remember that he is a Cortez. But Juni asks, \"What\\'s so special about being a Cortez?\", a question Gregorio is unable to answer. Before driving off, he notices Juni being pestered by one of the school bullies. He exits the car to try and resolve the conflict, but gets into a confrontation with the bully\\'s dad, who\\'s just as condescending. He fantasizes about beating up the dad to gain the love and appreciation of his disapproving son, but ultimately decides to back off. While having a moment to himself, Juni ponders out loud about running away to Floop\\'s world in the hope of escaping the pestering from Carmen and the school bullies and gaining a true friend.<br/><br/>Little does Juni know that far away in his castle off the coast of South America, Floop is in a pickle of his own; he is being contracted by Lisp (Robert Patrick), the head of a nameless corporation, to build an army for them, and so far, the candidates he\\'s given them (The Fooglies and Thumb-Thumbs, additional characters from the show) have been unsatisfactory to their liking. Floop then presents them with his newest invention: robot children, or as he calls them, \"Spy Kids.\" They resemble real-life children almost one-to-one while possessing the intelligence and cunning of the best super spies in the world. However, it\\'s revealed that they lack the brains, quite literally, to properly communicate. Lisp chastises Floop for not keeping with their schedule, and demands that he finish his army in two days or everything he\\'s built will be reduced to ashes.<br/><br/>Back at the Cortez house, Gregorio is prepping to go on assignment to investigate the disappearances of the OSS agents, and despite his objections, he eventually allows an overeager Ingrid to join him. They call Uncle Felix (Cheech Marin) to watch over Carmen and Juni, and after being given coordinates by OSS superior, Miss Gradenko (Teri Hatcher), make their way underwater thanks to their spy vehicle. For the first time in nine years, the Cortezes were back in the game, but their excitement is cut short after realizing they now carry a heavy burden: concern for their children\\'s safety. However, their thoughts are interrupted when they suddenly pick up a transmission from Floop, telling them they have something he desires, and they find themselves being chased by a sub. Gregorio tries to outrun it, but soon he and Ingrid end up getting engulfed by a much larger sub.<br/><br/>Back at the Cortez house, alarms start sounding, which confuses the children but puts Felix on high alert. He tells them to follow him to another part of the house, while proceeding to explain everything along the way; Gregorio and Ingrid are retired spies, and in reality, he\\'s not their uncle, but rather an OSS agent assigned to protect them. He takes Carmen and Juni to a secret transport called a Super Guppy, then leaves to gather important valuables, telling the children to press the blue and green buttons in the Guppy in case he doesn\\'t return. The house is then invaded by Floop\\'s Thumb-Thumbs, whom Felix manages to hold off long enough for Carmen and Juni to escape in the Guppy. The Thumb-Thumbs give chase in their own boats, but the kids manage to flee underwater and continue on an automated course to their parents\\' safe house.<br/><br/>Imprisoned in Floop\\'s Castle, Gregorio and Ingrid make an attempt to escape, winding up in the Virtual Room where Floop films his show. While admiring the simulated environments around them, they fall into a trap door that takes them to the dining area, where Floop himself is waiting for them, unimpressed by their pitiful breakout attempt. He gets acquainted with his captives and informs them of why they and the other OSS agents were captured; he is seeking the \"Third Brain,\" an object of synthetic intelligence created and eventually destroyed by the OSS. Gregorio is revealed to have once been a part of the Third Brain Project twelve years ago, and he elaborates later on that when the OSS director expressed concern for the Brain\\'s potentially destructive capabilities, he ordered the project terminated. However, the Brain itself couldn\\'t be destroyed, so Gregorio faked its destruction and hid it away. He refuses to rebuild the project for Floop and is sent back to his cell via another trap door beneath his seat.<br/><br/>At the safe house, Carmen and Juni equip themselves with spy gear in hopes of rescuing their parents, and find a scrapbook containing pictures from their parents\\' wedding, leading them to figure out that Ingrid\\'s bedtime story was true all along. To their surprise, they\\'re visited by Miss Gradenko, who\\'s there to take them under her protection. She fills them in on Floop\\'s evil intentions and asks to know where Gregorio is keeping the Third Brain. This reminds Carmen to tell her the phrase, \"the Third Brain lives,\" as instructed by Felix back at the house, but that only prompts Gradenko and her men to start searching the safe house for the Brain. Juni then finds the Thumb-Thumbs outside destroying the Super Guppy, leading him to conclude Miss Gradenko is working for Floop, and after a series of scuffles and chases with jet packs, the two children manage to escape the rogue agents and Thumb-Thumbs with the Brain.<br/><br/>While Floop is filming his show, he comes to a realization that it is lacking a key element, but his state of exasperation is interrupted by news of the children\\'s escape from his assistant, Alexander Minion (Tony Shalhoub), a former OSS agent who was fired for attempting to insert his own personal concepts into the Third Brain Project. He pitches the idea of sending robotic clones identical to them to acquire the Brain, an idea that Floop reluctantly agrees to. They intercept Carmen and Juni at San Diablo, and despite Juni\\'s efforts to destroy the Brain, he and Carmen are subdued and the clones end up leaving with the Brain in their possession. Despite their success, Floop eventually confesses to Minion that he no longer has the will or resolve to continue in building the army, but this is right around the time that Minion decides to assume control over all his operations, and has the robot children lock Floop inside the Virtual Room.<br/><br/>To find their parents and stop Floop, Carmen and Juni are forced to find Isador \"Machete\" Cortez (Danny Trejo), Gregorio\\'s older brother and best man at his wedding. After they prove they\\'re his legitimate relatives, they ask for his help. However, he declines, as he had a falling out with his brother since he sells his tech to those good and bad, even Floop, and because he doesn\\'t want to feel burdened with watching over his brother for the rest of his life. He\\'s nice enough to offer them temporary lodging and a plane to get them to Floop\\'s Castle, but during the night, the kids steal some of Machete\\'s tech and a map of Floop\\'s Castle, flying away in the plane before he can stop them.<br/><br/>Along the way, they bicker and argue about their personal insecurities, which leads to them badly crippling the plane and eventually crash. Luckily, they jump ship into the water and sneak into Floop\\'s Castle through an underwater cave. They acquire the parents\\' location thanks to the Fooglies, but end up separated when Carmen falls into a Thumb-Thumb producing chamber and Juni winds up in the Virtual Room with Floop. He initially fears Floop, but when he learns of Minion\\'s evil intentions, he has a change of heart about him and, thanks to short-circuiting gum, frees the both of them. After bumping into Carmen, they make their way to the dungeon and free Ingrid and a Fooglie-ized Gregorio. Working together, they turn Gregorio back to normal and lure and trap Minion in the Fooglie-Making machine before making their way to the control room.<br/><br/>However, along the way, Carmen and Juni\\'s robotic clones apprehend the parents again. This leads to another showdown between the children and robots, while Floop tries to reprogram all the robots. Carmen and Juni manage to subdue their clones before meeting back up with their freed parents at Floop\\'s throne room where Lisp, Miss Gradenko, and a Fooglie-ized Minion are residing. The family prepares themselves to take on the massive army of robot children summoned to the throne room, each with a duplicate of the Brain within them. Machete shows up to offer assistance, but at the last minute, Floop is able to program purity of heart and mind into the robots, causing them to attack the villains instead, tossing them around like toys.<br/><br/>Afterward, Gregorio and Machete settle their past differences, Minion and Carmen and Juni\\'s clones become characters on Floop\\'s show, the robot army starts being used for the good of mankind, and Lisp and Gradenko presumably get arrested. As the film ends, the family is eating breakfast back home before receiving a communique from Devlin (George Clooney), Director of the OSS, requesting Carmen and Juni for a new assignment. Carmen tells him that the Cortezes will only accept missions not as individuals, but as a family, before ending the transmission.</div></div>'}\n",

Ray owns an occult bookstore and works as an unpopular children\\'s entertainer with Winston, Egon works in a laboratory at Columbia University conducting experiments into human emotion, and Peter hosts a pseudo-psychic television show. Peter\\'s former girlfriend Dana Barrett has had a son, Oscar, with an ex-husband, and works as a restorer at the Manhattan Museum of Art. After an incident in which Oscar\\'s baby carriage is controlled by an unseen force and drawn to a busy junction, Dana turns to the Ghostbusters for help. Meanwhile, Dana\\'s colleague Dr. Janosz Poha is indoctrinated by the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian, a powerful seventeenth-century tyrant and magician trapped in a painting in the gallery. Vigo orders Janosz to locate a child that Vigo can possess, allowing him to return to life on the New Year.<br/><br/>The Ghostbusters\\' investigation leads them to illegally excavate First Avenue at the point where the baby carriage stopped. Lowered underneath, Ray discovers a river of pink slime filling an abandoned pneumatic transit line. Attacked by the slime after obtaining a sample, Ray accidentally causes a city-wide blackout, and the Ghostbusters are arrested. They are found guilty of investigating the supernatural, but before they can be taken away, the slime taken as evidence reacts to the judge\\'s angry outburst and explodes, releasing two ghosts that proceed to devastate the courtroom. The Ghostbusters imprison the ghosts in exchange for the dismissal of all charges and that they be allowed to resume their Ghostbusting business.<br/><br/>Later, the slime invades Dana\\'s apartment and attacks her and Oscar. She seeks refuge with Peter, and the two begin to renew their relationship. Investigating the slime and Vigo\\'s history, the Ghostbusters discover that the slime reacts to emotions, and suspect that it has been generated by the negative attitudes of New Yorkers. While Peter and Dana have dinner together, Egon, Ray, and Winston explore the underground river of slime. While measuring the depth, Winston gets pulled into the flowing river, and Ray and Egon jump in after him. After they escape back to the surface Ray and Winston begin arguing, but Egon realizes that they are being influenced by the slime, so they strip off their clothes. They also learn the river is flowing directly to the museum.<br/><br/>The Ghostbusters go to the mayor with their suspicions, but are dismissed; the mayor\\'s assistant, Jack Hardemeyer, has them committed to a psychiatric hospital to protect the mayor\\'s interests as he runs for governor. Meanwhile, a spirit resembling Janosz in the form of a nanny kidnaps Oscar from Peter\\'s apartment, and Dana pursues them to the museum alone. After she enters, the museum is covered with a barrier of impenetrable slime.<br/><br/>New Year\\'s Eve sees a sudden increase of supernatural activity as the slime rises from the subway line and onto the city streets, causing widespread paranormal activity with ghosts attacking citizens. In response, the mayor fires Hardemeyer and has the Ghostbusters released. After heading to the museum, they are unable to breach the power of the slime barrier with their proton packs. Determining that they need a symbol of powerful positivity to rally the citizens and weaken the slime, the Ghostbusters use positively-charged mood slime, and a remix of \"Higher and Higher\" to animate the Statue of Liberty and pilot it through the streets before the cheering populace. As they arrive at the museum, the slime begins to recede and they use the Statue\\'s torch to break through the museum\\'s ceiling to attack Vigo and Janosz.<br/><br/>Janosz is neutralized with positively-charged slime, but Vigo immobilizes the Ghostbusters and attempts a transfer into Oscar\\'s body. A chorus of \"Auld Lang Syne\" by the citizens outside weakens Vigo, returning him to the painting and freeing the Ghostbusters. Vigo, now a grotesque beast, momentarily possesses Ray, and the other Ghostbusters attack him with a combination of proton streams and positively-charged mood slime. Dressed in full Ghostbusters attire, Louis attacks the weakened slime barrier around the building with a proton stream of his own. This combination destroys Vigo and changes the painting to a likeness of the four Ghostbusters standing protectively around Oscar. Outside, the Ghostbusters receive a standing ovation from the crowd and, at a later ceremony to restore the Statue, the Key to the City from the mayor.</div></div>'}\n",

He then takes his brother out and leaves Archer in prison. But Archer somehow manages to escape and is now trying to find someone who will believe and help him, while Troy is plotting something.<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=rcs0411%40yahoo.com&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_4\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">rcs0411@yahoo.com</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">FBI Special Agent Sean Archer tries to find a biological weapon placed in Los Angeles by a sadistic terrorist-for-hire and criminal mastermind named Castor Troy.

As they ride around, Archer runs his hand over Michael\\'s face and smiles.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) sets up a suppressed sniper rifle on the hill overlooking the carousel. He takes aim at Archer, waits until he gets a clean shot, and fires. The bullet hits Archer in the back, and he and his son fall off the horse, leaving a noticeable bloodstain on the horse\\'s mane. Three balloons are seen drifting away into the sky.<br/><br/>Moments later, Archer is shown lying on his stomach, in pain, the bullet having gone cleanly through his body as bystanders rush over to him. Though bleeding, he sees Michael lying a few feet away, dead, the bullet having struck him in the head. Tears stinging his eyes, Archer crawls over and holds his dead son\\'s body while Castor looks up from the scope of his rifle, stunned to see that he has just killed a child. The carousel horse Archer was riding on spins round and round and quickly fades out.<br/><br/>Six Years Later:<br/><br/>Archer is the field agent in charge of the FBI\\'s Los Angeles field office and has been relentlessly pursuing Castor ever since the assassination attempt. Castor is a career terrorist, responsible for countless terrorist bombings, aircraft hijackings, and political assassinations, among other crimes. Archer looks at a wall documenting a long list of commendations given to him for his years of dedicated hard work and service, then somberly holsters his pistol and approaches his coworkers. We see that Archer carries the burden of his son\\'s death on his shoulders at all times from his walk. He is agitated that his closest agents, Tito Blondi (Robert Wisdom), Wanda (Margaret Cho), Buzz (James Denton), and Loomis (Matt Ross) have no information on Castor\\'s latest whereabouts.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Castor poses as a minister to sneak into the Los Angeles Convention Center, where he assembles and arms a big bomb called \"Sinclaire\". As he leaves, he cannot resist the opportunity to headbang to a choir singing the Hallelujah chorus and grope a blonde choir girl.<br/><br/>At the FBI office, Archer finishes up a heated phone call with director Victor Lazarro (Harve Presnell). His secretary Kim Brewster (Romy Windsor) comes in to inform him that his wife Eve is on line 1 trying to call him. But simultaneously, Tito bursts in to tell Archer that Castor\\'s brother Pollux just chartered a jet at a local airfield and paid it in cash. Archer immediately orders Tito to get an undercover agent planted on the plane. Tito is about to protest that they don\\'t have any sign of Castor, but Archer counters Pollux \"doesn\\'t fly without big brother!\" and marches out of the office, ignoring the fact that his wife is on hold.<br/><br/>Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola) is shown waiting impatiently in his convertible on the tarmac of a local airfield with his cronies Leo (Tommy Flanagan) and Lars (Dana Smith). He is relieved when Castor drives up in his own car. He climbs out and walks over to Pollux, and converses as Leo and Lars change his coat and sunglasses. Pollux is annoyed that Castor is running 26 minutes behind schedule. Castor lights a cigarette and asks Pollux if he hasn\\'t deviated from their plans. Pollux admits that he paid for the jet himself to save them time. Castor reminds him that that is for the boys to handle so they can hide their movements, but he\\'s not going to kill Pollux for such a screw-up because he loves him too much to do such a thing. He then bends over and quickly ties Pollux\\'s shoelaces. Castor then tempts Leo and Lars with a gold money clip of $100 bills, only to snatch them away. He and Pollux then break into grins as he advises his men to stay away from downtown on the 18th, when things are going to be a little.... \"smoggy\". Castor and Pollux then board the plane, where they are greeted by Winters, an undercover agent posing as a flight attendant, whom Castor quickly seduces.<br/><br/>As the plane turns and prepares to start its takeoff roll, the pilot suddenly sees a Humvee on the runway, driving towards them. Simultaneously, Pollux looks out the window just as multiple police cars and a helicopter suddenly appear behind the jet and give chase. Castor gets up from his seat and rushes into the cockpit to take a look at the oncoming vehicle. Not to his surprise, Archer is driving the car, and Tito is riding shotgun.<br/><br/>At that point, Winters whips out her pistol and trains it on Castor. Pollux promptly throws his briefcase at her, holds her down, and beats her senseless. Castor puts a pistol to the pilot\\'s head and orders him to fly the plane. The plane and Archer continue to close in on each other. It looks as if Archer is on a collision course with the landing gear, but he swerves at the last second and drives past the plane, then swings a U-turn to fall in line behind the plane. Archer then floors on the gas pedal. He has pulled up alongside the wings when the cabin door suddenly opens and Castor pushes the disarmed Winters out the door, and makes Archer watch him execute her with a bullet to the back. Archer stops the Humvee and promptly jumps into the helicopter, and takes off before Tito can protest.<br/><br/>Seeing Archer closing in, Castor puts his pistol to the pilot\\'s head and orders him to take off. Archer promptly lowers the helicopter and rams the skids against the left wing flaps, jamming them. The pilot makes several futile attempts to pull back on the throttles, until the flaps break off completely. Trying to see what is keeping his plane on the ground, Castor peeks out the wing exit door. He raises his pistol and fires at Archer. Several bullets pierce the glass, but Archer ducks down, unharmed. Castor ducks back inside, while Archer sticks his pistol out and shoots out the left engines. Sparks issue from the engines and the engine fire alarm goes off on the pilot\\'s control panels. Castor promptly executes the pilot, takes his seat at the controls, and quickly diverts the plane off the runway, putting it on a collision course with a hangar. Castor powers down the throttles, just seconds before the nose of the plane smashes through the glass windows in the side of the hangar and sends debris and parts flying everywhere.<br/><br/>Archer lands the helicopter as the other police units screech to a halt around the back of the plane and officers begin taking up positions. Sparks fly as Castor whips out twin pistols, jumps out of the plane, and opens fire. One agent standing on the wing of the plane is shot dead instantly, as is a cop standing on the ground. Pollux draws a submachine gun, fires a volley at Archer, and jumps out, following Castor. Archer jumps onto the roof of a police car and fires his pistol. Tito fires a submachine gun, driving Pollux further back into the hangar. Castor then breaks cover and fires both pistols rapidly. In the exchange, Loomis is hit, a bullet shearing off part of his left ear.<br/><br/>Castor calls out to Pollux, but Archer shoots at a water hose pipe. The bullet bursts a joint in the pipe, spraying water into Pollux\\'s face. Pollux is driven out from cover, at which point Tito grabs him from behind and shoves him into a wooden shipping crate. Wanda then kicks him in the chest, then throws him on his stomach and handcuffs him. Meanwhile, Castor ambushes and shoots a SWAT officer at point-blank range with his pistol, then uses the officer\\'s shotgun to shoot another agent. He then turns to see Tito and Wanda handcuffing Pollux, who cries out to Castor. Castor ignores him and rushes deeper into the hangar. A few agents haul Pollux away while Archer and a group of agents and cops rush in and split up to search for him.<br/><br/>Deeper in the hangar, Castor hides and lies in wait. Archer enters, his pistol drawn, searching between the stacks of shipping crates. He turns his weapon when he hears the echo of Castor reloading his pistol. Archer breaks cover and finds another agent, Berkeley, in the line of fire. He shouts a warning to Berkeley, but it comes too late. Castor turns and fires, hitting Berkeley in the back and killing him instantly. Archer fires once at Castor. Castor fires his shotgun at Archer, sending Archer scrambling for cover. Castor then drops the shotgun and draws his second pistol. Another agent, Buzz (Jamie Denton), draws his pistol and breaks cover. Archer tackles him to the ground just as Castor turns on Buzz and opens fire. Archer raises his pistol and his backup revolver and fires back at Castor. They continue firing until both run out of ammunition.<br/><br/>Archer takes cover behind a wooden shipping crate and reloads his pistol. Simultaneously, Castor reloads his pistols. Hearing the sound of clicking, he looks up to see Castor standing above him. Archer scrambles behind some crates as Castor opens fire on him again. Archer shoots a hook tying a steel pulley chain to the ground, grabs the chain, and uses it to take the high ground as he fires at Castor. Castor slides down a ramp, firing and shooting a submachine gun-wielding agent. He lands next to an active turbine.<br/><br/>Before Castor can stand up, Archer lands next to him and jams his pistol to his neck. Castor laughs and dares Archer to shoot him because he only has one round left in his weapon. They stand up and train pistols on each other. Engaged in a Mexican standoff, Castor tries to convince Archer to turn against his fellow men and try terrorism-for-hire, though it is clear he\\'s trying to provoke Archer. Castor takes the opportunity to brag that he has a bomb that will deliver \"Hell\"-A the biblical plague it deserves, though Archer believes he is bluffing. Castor also brags that he knows Archer will just drive his family crazy now that his enemy will be locked up.<br/><br/>Asking if Archer\\'s daughter Jamie is \"ripe\", Castor tries to shoot Archer, but the magazine clicks empty. He gets on his knees and breaks down, seemingly scared, but it is actually an act as we see that he is using the opportunity to secretly grab a knife from his pocket. Then he breaks into a grin and dares Archer to pull the trigger, singing, \"I\\'m ready! Ready for the big ride, baby!\" He promptly stands up, knife in his right hand. Archer kicks Castor\\'s hand, disarming him. He then kicks Castor into the backdraft of the turbine. Archer hits a button and the turbine produces a sudden blast of hot air that sends Castor flying backwards until he hits a ventilation grate and falls motionless.<br/><br/>Archer returns home, and we see that his family life is less than optimal. His daughter Jamie gets in trouble a lot, and his relationship with his wife Eve seems somewhat distant due to all of the time he\\'s spent looking for Castor. Nonetheless, he assures Eve that he will petition his boss to grant him a desk job so he can spend time rebuilding their relationship.<br/><br/>Back at the office, the employees congratulate Archer as he slowly walks into the office, looking crestfallen. His secretary gives him a bottle of champagne that has been sent by the CIA to commend Archer for stopping Castor. Archer tries to refuse it, unhappy with the fact that it says \"Just for you\" and does not have the names of all the agents shot dead in the shootout.<br/><br/>Archer logs onto his computer and presses some buttons to declare the Castor Troy case closed. He is interrupted when Tito and a Special Ops agent, Hollis Miller (C.C.H Pounder), come in. Miller produces a floppy disk found in Pollux\\'s briefcase. Archer plugs it into his computer. Graphics of an animated woman come up to the tune of suggestive music, as well as the sound of audible moaning. The words \"My name is Sinclaire, and I am going to blow you AWAY!\" show up on the screen. As \"AWAY!\" shows up, the animated woman briefly flashes into a skeleton. Schematics of \"Sinclaire\" show up on the screen. Archer identifies it as a biological weapon. Miller warns that the fall out would be enough to flatten much of LA, and Archer realizes Castor was not bluffing about a biblical plague.<br/><br/>Getting more information on the bomb, though, is more difficult because Pollux will only talk about the bomb with Castor, and Castor is presumably deceased. An attempt to interrogate Pollux about the bomb schematics fails due to Pollux fooling the polygraph, and Archer refuses to take Lazarro\\'s suggestion that he just let the matter go. Miller tells Archer that they could put an undercover agent in a prison cell with Pollux to get him to slip information, but Archer shoots that down. Miller proposes that there might be an alternate solution.<br/><br/>Miller takes Archer out to the Walsh Institute, a private medical institution that specializes in various types of state-of-the-art surgical operations. Archer enters the recovery ward, where, to his disbelief, he sees that Castor is in a medically induced coma and is on life support. Miller assures Archer that Castor is not going anywhere, demonstrating this by stubbing out her cigarette on Castor\\'s skin, to which Castor does not even twitch. Miller, and the institute\\'s director Dr. Malcolm Walsh (Colm Feore), give Archer an ambitious proposal: they would like Archer to take Castor\\'s face and voice, then go into Erewhon Prison posing as Castor to extract information on \"Sinclaire\" from Pollux.<br/><br/>Dr. Walsh reveals that he is capable of performing surgeries to alter the facial appearance or voice of a person. To demonstrate, he and Miller show Archer into the observation deck for another operating room where surgeons are working on Loomis, the agent shot in the ear during the shootout with Castor in the hanger. As Dr. Walsh continues talking, lasers are shown constructing a new earlobe, that is then surgically stitched onto the stump of Loomis\\'s original ear. Dr. Walsh explains that the surgery they propose Archer undertake to become Castor is much less permanent than what Loomis is getting. He explains the more technical details: Archer\\'s blood type does not match Castor\\'s but this will not be something Pollux will notice, and the height difference is easy to correct. Archer\\'s skin and eye pigment color is also close enough to Castor\\'s to be a reasonable match. Laser shears will be used to trim Archer\\'s hair to Castor\\'s length and appearance, microplugs to build up additional chest hair, an abdominoplasty that rebuilds Archer\\'s midsection to more closely resemble Castor\\'s. Dr. Walsh then shows Archer the true innovation: a morphogenetic template, the inside of which is modeled on Archer\\'s skull but has an exterior modeled to resemble Castor\\'s face, meaning he won\\'t feel any different at all.<br/><br/>Archer finds the whole plan insane and starts to leave, but Miller stops him, reminding him that he has chased Castor for many years. He is convinced that getting Castor\\'s gang to talk is easier, even though Miller warns him that Castor will effectively win if the bomb blows up.<br/><br/>Archer decides to instead first try interrogating known associates of Castor\\'s. On the first two guys he tries to interrogate, he grills them so intensely that one of them pees in his pants. Late at night, he interrogates Castor\\'s longtime girlfriend Sasha Hassler (Gina Gershon). She refuses to talk at first, but Archer warns her that she is on probation for previous criminal charges including harboring Castor, and gets her to talk by threatening to put her son Adam up in a foster home. She finally claims that she hasn\\'t seen Castor in years. Archer then interrogates Sasha\\'s brother Dietrich (Nick Cassavetes), who functions as Castor\\'s bomb and weapons supplier. Archer tells him that the bomb has his signature written all over it. Dietrich scoffs, stating Archer has no real evidence against him. Things go sour when Dietrich decides to insult Archer by asking him about his deceased son. Archer snaps with rage, tackles Dietrich to the floor, and jams the barrel of his pistol into Dietrich\\'s eye. Dietrich finally admits that all he knows is that the bomb goes off on the 18th.<br/><br/>As he watches Sasha and Dietrich leave the office, Archer is met again by Tito and Miller. Archer does not want to submit to the operation without Lazarro being notified, but Miller tells him that this is actually a black bag operation, meaning that it is classified and off-the-books (no paperwork), and Archer is not allowed to tell Lazarro or Eve anything about the mission. Feeling that he has nothing to lose, Archer accepts the mission.<br/><br/>After giving farewells to Eve and Jamie, Archer heads to the Walsh Institute and prepares for the surgery. He gives Tito his wedding ring and tells him to hold onto it for safekeeping. He asks Dr. Walsh if he can also restore the scar from the bullet wound Archer received from Castor years ago after the operation is over. Dr. Walsh agrees. Archer leaves Tito and follows Dr. Walsh to prepare for sedation.<br/><br/>The surgery begins. Archer and Castor are both sedated, then are wheeled into the operating room on separate tables. Dr. Walsh first uses a pen to trace the area of skin to be removed from Archer\\'s face. He then uses a special laser to run along the line and isolate the skin. A suction cup is then lowered, and pulls off the entire section of skin comprising Archer\\'s forehead, eyelids, nose, mouth, cheeks, and chin, exposing the raw muscles. Dr. Walsh then deposits the original skin on a facial template stored in a container of water to keep it from drying out. The same process is then repeated on Castor while a technician cuts Archer\\'s hair. Castor\\'s face is then put on top of Archer\\'s exposed muscles and then connected to the rest of his skin muscles. Then the blood vessels are reconnected and the surgery is completed.<br/><br/>A few days later, Castor is back in his own hospital bed, his head wrapped up in bandages like a mummy. Meanwhile, Archer (now played by Nicolas Cage) wakes up and his bandages are unwrapped. He freaks out upon seeing Castor\\'s face in the mirror and tries to destroy it with the base of a coat hanger. He is quickly calmed down by Miller and Tito, who administer a sedative. Archer calms down, and he asks Tito and Miller to burn his new face once he\\'s gotten the information he needs.<br/><br/>Archer then notices that his voice hasn\\'t changed yet. This problem is fixed with the next part of the operation. Dr. Walsh implants a microchip in Archer\\'s larynx, and warns him to be careful as something as mundane as a sharp blow or violent sneeze could dislodge it. Dr. Walsh then plays back a short clip from an audiotape of Castor talking normally (in which he states \"Peach. I could eat a peach for hours\"), and instructs Archer to repeat back the line. It takes a few tries, but eventually Archer is able to get his voice to perfectly emulate Castor\\'s. Archer is reminded that he has six days until the bomb goes off to get information from Pollux.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, at the LA Convention Center, the bomb\\'s clock continues counting down.<br/><br/>Archer is next seen being led by Tito up to the helicopter landing pad where guards from the Erehwon Prison (\"Nowhere\" spelled in reverse) are waiting to pick him up. Tito tells him he has two days to get Pollux to talk, after which Miller will come in to withdraw him regardless. Archer is still complaining about an itch as he adjusts to his new face. Tito helps him by massaging his cheeks with his thumbs. Two prison guards grab Archer and begin leading him to the helicopter. He gives a longing look towards Buzz, Wanda, Loomis and Tito as they see him off. A blindfold is then lowered over Archer\\'s face.<br/><br/>When Archer\\'s face is unmasked again, he is shirtless and under a bright spotlight in a dimly lit room, being watched over by several guards. The prison warden, Walton (John Carroll Lynch), comes in, shines a flashlight in Archer\\'s face, and analyzes him, telling him, \"You are now the property of Erewhon Prison. A citizen of nowhere. The Geneva Convention is void here; Amnesty International doesn\\'t know we exist. When I say your ass belongs to me, I mean exactly that.\" Archer\\'s feet are then clamped tight in magnetic boots tied to a field that allows the guards to monitor the location of every prisoner 24/7.<br/><br/>Archer is then shown in the cafeteria line, trudging along as a nature channel plays images of various landscapes 24/7 on a large TV monitor. All of the inmates stop what they are doing upon seeing Archer. Archer comes dangerously close to blowing his own cover when he\\'s stopped by another inmate that he recognizes as Burke Hicks, whom he arrested many years ago for stalking the UN Secretary General, a crime for which Hicks has always claimed he was framed. Archer is turning around and about to talk to Pollux when another inmate, a hulky Russian named Ivan Dubov, who seeks revenge on the real Castor ever since Castor had three-way sex with his wife and sister, attacks him. Dubov gives Archer an intense beating, throwing him around, leaving Archer with a bloody nose. After a brief moment to catch his breath, Archer regains his composure, and eventually gets the upper hand, defeating Dubov with a lunch tray. He\\'s shocked at how close he\\'s come to becoming the very likeness of his enemy. At the end of the fight, Archer\\'s magnetic boots are clamped to the EM field and Walton prods him in the back with a stun gun. He then warns Dubov of the consequences he will face the next time he picks a fight with someone.<br/><br/>Back at the Walsh Institute, the real Castor is still asleep. His heart rate begins accelerating, and then he suddenly bolts upright. He is stunned to find that his face is completely wrapped in bandages. He pulls them off and discovers that the skin on his face is gone, leaving the muscle exposed. He touches the exposed muscles to verify that he is not hallucinating. Despite being in great pain, he hobbles over to the edge of the room and sees Archer\\'s old face floating in a jar. He calls Lars and Leo on a phone in his wing and tells them to come immediately.<br/><br/>Lars and Leo abduct Dr. Walsh and transport him to the Institute in their car. They march him to the operating room at gunpoint, where they find Castor sitting in a chair, smoking a cigarette and watching the videotape of the surgery while listening to classical music (the video itself was recorded so Dr. Walsh could undo the surgery after the mission was completed). Watching the tape finish, Castor starts clapping, finding the entire thing very impressive. Castor advances towards Dr. Walsh, who, frightened, asks Castor what he wants. Castor claps his hands several times and we see his faceless face appear reflected in Dr. Walsh\\'s glasses to reply, \"Take one goddamn guess.\"<br/><br/>Back at Erehwon, Archer sits down with Pollux and successfully manages to extract information from him about the bomb. Later, he is in his cell when a guard stops by to tell him that he has a visitor. Archer is escorted to the visitor\\'s room. Once he is in the room, the magnetic boots are activated, securing Archer\\'s feet to the floor. He is hoping the visitor is Miller and Tito coming to release him. Instead, to his shock, in walks Castor Troy (now played by John Travolta), wearing Archer\\'s old face and business suit, and all too happy to see that Archer is locked up in prison under his name. He likens the effect as being like looking into a mirror, only not. He is mildly annoyed about having his face cut off to disturb his coma and thrusts a newspaper article into Archer\\'s face about a recent fire that destroyed the Walsh Institute and killed Dr. Walsh and two of his lab technicians.<br/><br/>Hearing the news from Castor, images flash through Archer\\'s head of Dr. Walsh, Miller and Tito tied up and gagged on the floor of the Institute as Leo and Lars douse them with jugs of gasoline. One of them then flicks a Zippo lighter and drops it in a puddle of gasoline, starting a fire that burns them alive.<br/><br/>Castor then flashes Archer\\'s wedding ring into Archer\\'s face, as he casually reveals that he has killed Tito, and has destroyed any evidence that Archer could potentially use to prove who he is. Now he has plans to abuse Archer\\'s job and even make love to Eve. Archer does not take this well and immediately tries to strangle Castor with his bare hands, but is stopped when guards rush in and restrain him. Castor thanks Walton for saving him, then departs while Archer can only resign himself to his new predicament.<br/><br/>Upon returning to the city, Castor immediately heads for his new house. As he is driving through the neighborhood, he looks in utter disbelief at all of the nicely manicured lawns and well-kept houses. He is distracted enough that he \"accidentally\" overshoots his own house right in front of Eve as she is walking to her car. He backs up to the curb, and smirks as his climbs out of the car. Eve chides Castor for finally forgetting where they lived. Castor insists that she give him a break, as every house looks the same. Eve asks Castor about his \"vital assignment\". Castor spaces out for a moment, but finally realizes that this refers to Archer\\'s current impersonation of him, and gives a lie about an \"out-of-body experience\" (which in a way is partially true). He can\\'t help but stare at her butt as she leaves for work at the hospital.<br/><br/>Castor goes inside and sits down at a desk in the living room, to settle himself down in his new life. He quickly finds Eve\\'s diary in a drawer. He is somewhat stunned, upon reading a recent entry, to find that Archer hasn\\'t had sex with Eve in over two months. Before he can dwell on the matter, he is distracted upon hearing his favorite song \"Papa\\'s Got a Brand New Bag\" playing from Jamie\\'s bedroom. He heads upstairs to find Jamie talking on the phone with her boyfriend while smoking a cigarette in just her underwear and a cropped t-shirt. Castor quips, \"Hmm, the plot thickens....\" Jamie, angered at Castor\\'s invasion of her privacy, tries to slam the door on him, but Castor forces his way in, itching for her hidden stash of cigarettes. He narrowly comes close to blowing his cover by calling her \"Janie\" until he notices her name stitched on her bed pillow and corrects himself. Jamie is confused why her \"father\" has taken up smoking, to which Castor explains, \"You\\'ll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Papa\\'s got a brand new bag.\" He then slowly backs out of the room while singing along to the music.<br/><br/>At Erehwon, Archer tries to come to terms with the reality that Castor has taken over his life. If anything could make him feel worse, it is when he learns that Castor has cut a \"deal\" with Pollux to turn state\\'s evidence that also includes immediate release from jail.<br/><br/>Pollux is taken to the FBI office, where Castor plays \"good cop\" by treating him to a gourmet meal. Castor comes into the observation room, where Wanda and Buzz offer him their condolences for Tito\\'s death. Castor shrugs them off. There is a brief disturbance when Lazarro comes in and confronts Castor to point out that cutting a deal with a lowlife like Pollux is something the real Archer would never do. Castor dismisses him, claiming that he\\'s trying \"fresh tactics\". After everyone else leaves the observation room, Castor switches off the videotape, then enters the interrogation room and turns off the microphone while reminding Pollux that he\\'s supposed to be snitching. Pollux tells Castor that seeing Archer\\'s face on him makes him want to cough up his tiramisu. Castor proposes that they can do better if Pollux just \"confesses\" to the location of the bomb, thinking he will look a lot more impressive and gain media attention that Archer will envy if he single-handedly disarms the bomb.<br/><br/>Armed with Castor\\'s \"tip\" from Pollux, the police converge on the Convention Center and hurriedly evacuate the building. Inside, Castor watches over two bomb squad technicians trying to disarm the bomb. There is one minute and 15 seconds remaining on the clock. The techs tell Castor that the codes are protected by a tamper switch that will take them several hours to bypass. Castor sternly orders them to leave. Once they are gone, he goes about disarming the bomb in dramatic flair. He bypasses the protective systems, then punches in the disarm code to deactivate the bomb with just two seconds remaining on the clock. Satisfied, he then closes the timer panel.<br/><br/>After watching Castor being interviewed on CNN, Archer is shown sulking in his cell, clearly a broken man. At the FBI office, meanwhile, Castor revels in the glory as the other agents congratulate him for disarming the bomb. In contrast to Archer, who is known for usually darkening the mood of his victories by reminding his men of the agents killed in their gunfights, Castor is all smiles, wears his sunglasses indoors, and thanks his men for putting up with him for all the years he was an insufferable bore. Some of the agents, like Archer\\'s partner Wanda, wonder if Castor just had surgery (which seems to strike a small chord with Castor). He is also more tender and affectionate with Eve than the real Archer is. For instance, when Castor is told by his secretary that the president and his wife are both on the phone trying to contact him, Castor asks her to put the president on hold.<br/><br/>Desperate, Archer realizes that the only way he can stop Castor is to break out of prison, so he asks Burke Hicks about the odds of escape during exercise hour. Hicks tells him he can\\'t escape: he can only get his boots off if he is taken down to the clinic to get shock treatment. Archer immediately notices a guard pulling out a pack of cigarettes and knowing that Castor smokes, he gets an idea. He breaks out of line, walks over to the guard, and demands a cigarette. When the guard orders him to get back in line, Archer punches him, instigating a fight with several other guards, who grab him and drag him away even as he yells to the incited inmates for someone to give him a match.<br/><br/>Down in the clinic, Dubov is getting shock therapy in the chair, having apparently picked another fight and failed to heed Walton\\'s warning following his earlier fight with Archer. When they are done with Dubov, they pull him out of the chair and Archer, being dragged by his shoulders, is put in the chair. He successfully manages to get Walton to light a cigarette for him. As they are securing him, Archer tells Dubov that he didn\\'t touch Dubov\\'s wife or sister and knows that they are waiting for him.<br/><br/>The guards are about to put the arm restraints on Archer when Dubov suddenly clubs Walton over the back. Several guards hear the raucous and charge Dubov with batons. Dubov swiftly disarms each one of them, and Archer breaks free of the chair. A guard on the catwalk above opens fire with a submachine gun. Archer grabs a pistol and shoots him. Archer then takes cover as another guard appears and opens fire, forcing him into a corner. Dubov takes cover behind a stretcher. The guard fires at Dubov until Archer suddenly shoots him in the foot from below, and he collapses. The elevator doors open on the clinic floor and several guards appear. They open fire on Dubov and continue shooting until he shoves the gurney into them, disarming them.<br/><br/>Seeing two more guards coming on the catwalk, Archer grabs a bottle of sulfuric acid from the medical supply cabinet and chucks it upwards. Archer then shoots the bottle in midair, causing a small explosion that knocks one guard off the catwalk and forces the other one to retreat. Archer and Dubov then jump up to the catwalk and start running. The other guard stands up, but Dubov takes the first guard\\'s submachine gun and shoots him. Archer then climbs up a ladder, scales a wall, and jumps on another guard, tackling him, as a riot breaks out in the exercise hall.<br/><br/>In the control room, panic breaks out as Dubov suddenly fires his submachine gun through the door. One guard fires at Archer as he runs along another catwalk, and continues firing until Dubov shoots him from behind. He then begins killing the guards in the control room until Archer arrives and orders him to stop. Archer tells the two remaining guards to leave, then sits down at the computer and starts typing in codes hoping to overload the security system. Before he can start, another guard opens fire on them, sending Archer diving for cover. Dubov fires his submachine gun and offs the guard and one other guard, and continues shooting until a third guard, who had taken cover, stabs him in the leg with a knife.<br/><br/>Archer then frantically types codes in to disable the security system, as Dubov whips and overpowers the guard who stabbed him, then tosses him over the railing into the cafeteria. Sparks fly as Archer overloads the TV screen. Just then, a bloodied Walton appears on the cafeteria floor, raises a rifle at Dubov, and fires. Three bullets hit Dubov in his chest. Dubov flails around and falls over the edge. Archer grabs him by the barrel of his gun and tries to pull Dubov back up. However, Dubov is weakened by his wounds. His grip slips and he falls to his death. Walton fires up at Archer, but is stopped when Burke Hicks and a couple other inmates surround him and apparently beat him to death.<br/><br/>Now safe, Archer makes his way up a stairway to the roof, only to find that the prison is an offshore oil platform in the Pacific Ocean just off the California shore. Before he can think about how he is out of luck, a helicopter appears. Archer runs and jumps off the edge of the helicopter platform as the gunner opens fire on him. Archer lands on the next deck down, and runs for the edge, only for the helicopter to show up and chase him back across the deck. He lands behind some oil cans. One shot causes a spark that lights Archer\\'s feet on fire. Archer quickly removes his socks and does a running jump off the platform into the ocean. Archer does not surface and the helicopter pilots presume him deceased.<br/><br/>Back at Castor\\'s house, it is Michael\\'s birthday. Castor is roped by Eve into going to Michael\\'s grave. Castor watches Eve place some toys on the angel-shaped tombstone. She breaks down crying in Castor\\'s arms. Castor appears to be ashamed of himself for his own actions. When Castor returns to his office later that day, he is told by his coworkers that Archer has escaped from prison. Suspicious, he asks to see the body. When he\\'s told it has not been recovered, Castor realizes that Archer is alive and will be coming for him.<br/><br/>After his jailbreak, Archer swims to shore. That night, still in his prison shirt, he steals a car from a valet parking lot, then drives over to the hospital where Eve works. He makes a call from the car phone and tries to warn Eve about Castor. However, his vocal chip causes him to speak with Castor\\'s natural husky voice, which Eve does not recognize, instead of his real and much more nasally voice. She thinks someone is impersonating her husband and she hangs up on him. Frantic to alert someone he trusts to Castor\\'s whereabouts, Archer calls the FBI office and asks to be put through to Lazarro, hoping to warn him, but to his dismay, he is transferred by the operator to Castor. Hearing Castor pick up the phone, Archer quickly hangs up and continues driving, switching off a radio report about the police manhunt Castor has declared on him. He then has to lower his head and make a quick right turn when he spots a police car approaching in front of him.<br/><br/>Unable to alert any of his colleagues or his wife, Archer decides to drive to the penthouse apartment where Dietrich lives. In the apartment, Dietrich is in the middle of a phone call as he enters his apartment and is stunned, then delighted upon seeing Archer-as-Castor. He invites Archer in and takes him upstairs to the second floor of the apartment, where several of Castor\\'s old buddies and their girlfriends are hanging out. They all are pleased to see \"Castor\".<br/><br/>Archer sits down in a chair and Dietrich hands him a box containing some of Castor\\'s regular contraband: several joints, prescription pills, a box of Chiclets, a money clip, and two gold-plated pistols (identical to the ones Castor was utilizing during the earlier shootout with Archer when they both had their original faces). He takes a moment to pick up the pistols to see how they feel and forces himself to take drug-laced water.<br/><br/>Dietrich asks Archer what he plans to do. Archer declares that he\\'s going to use their help to take down Castor. Castor\\'s other accomplices point out that \"Archer\" is a supercop, leading Archer to disclose details about himself, like the fact that his own house security code is the same as Michael\\'s birthday. To explain how he knows so much about himself, Archer explains that \"he\" sleeps with Castor\\'s wife. As to what he plans to do once he abducts Castor, Archer claims he wants to take Castor\\'s face....off and stick it on himself. Naturally, Castor\\'s pals think Archer is just spouting pure gibberish.<br/><br/>Feeling his body rejecting the drugs, Archer dismisses himself from the conversation and rushes to the bathroom. He tries to rinse his face clean, then he looks in the mirror and immediately draws one of his pistols on the reflection. Archer quickly talks himself out of his panic attack, and is interrupted by the arrival of Sasha. She glowers at him as he turns around, a slasher-style grin frozen on his face. He insists that he is not dead, at which point Sasha slaps him.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Castor is in his living room and in the middle of a heated phone call with Pollux. He reminds Pollux that once he is able to use Archer\\'s job to get rid of their criminal rivals, he\\'ll be set and get his old face back. He is interrupted by music, walks over to the window and sees Jamie\\'s boyfriend Karl (Danny Masterson) pulling up in the driveway with Jamie in tow. As Jamie prepares to get out of the car, Karl attempts to advance on her. She turns him down, however Karl gets more insistent and more forceful in his advances. Seeing the struggle, Castor quickly hangs up the phone on Pollux. Karl has forced himself onto Jamie and is holding her down when Castor suddenly smashes the window with his foot, pulls him out of the car, and then gives him a vicious beating, before slamming his head against the roof and ordering him to apologize. After extracting an apology, Castor throws him aside one last time for good measure.<br/><br/>Minutes later, Castor is talking to Jamie about the incident. As they talk, Castor begins to see past the exterior Jamie has put put in front of her family and sees what really is bothering her inside (something the real Archer has failed to notice): she has never come to terms with Michael\\'s death at Castor\\'s hands, has outwardly blamed Archer for not doing a better job in protecting their family and has mistrusted him since. As consolation, and not wanting to see Jamie get hurt, he gives her a butterfly knife for \"protection\", and instructs her to, if she gets attacked, stab the would-be attacker in the thigh and twist the blade so that the wound won\\'t be able to close.<br/><br/>Back at Dietrich\\'s penthouse, Archer is shirtless and lying facedown on a bed, with Sasha sitting next to him. He is woken up when Sasha nibbles his shoulder, and mistakenly addresses her as Eve. Realizing she\\'s not Eve, he bolts awake and instinctively grabs one of his pistols. Sasha takes off Archer\\'s pants and tries to make advances on him. Archer naturally freaks out. Unbeknownst to either of them, Pollux is standing on a roof across the street watching them through binoculars. Amused to see that Archer is beginning to \"enjoy\" being his enemy, he phones Castor.<br/><br/>Archer is finally able to get Sasha off him and puts on a leather jacket. She tells him to leave, recalling threats Archer made with his original face to put her son Adam up in a foster home. Upon seeing Adam, Archer is surprised to learn that Castor is Adam\\'s biological father, something the real Castor has never had knowledge of. He immediately begins to regret threatening her, realizing that Sasha is just a single mother struggling to raise Adam to avoid a criminal life.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, alerted to Archer\\'s whereabouts, Castor sends an FBI SWAT team to take up positions on the rooftop across the street and train submachine guns at the windows of the penthouse.<br/><br/>Inside, Archer learns that Adam is five years old, almost the same age his own son Michael was when he died, and also learns that Sasha has kept the fact that Adam is Castor\\'s son a secret, fearing someone would hurt Adam to get to Castor. Sasha encourages Adam to meet his \"father\". Archer puts his hand on Adam\\'s face and immediately has a flashback, recalling running his hand over Michael\\'s face on a carousel ride just before his death. Seeing so much of Michael in Adam, Archer accidentally blurts his real son\\'s name while hugging Adam, to Sasha\\'s confusion. Sasha quickly grabs Adam and pulls him away from Archer, asking Archer what is wrong with him.<br/><br/>On cue, an FBI agent across the street fires a grenade launcher. A smoke grenade suddenly crashes through the bedroom window. Archer quickly pulls Sasha and Adam to the ground as the SWAT team opens fire with submachine guns, raking the windows with bullets. The men and women gathered in the loft immediately panic. Dietrich, Aldo and the other thugs quickly grab their weapons.<br/><br/>While taking cover behind the bed, Archer quickly grabs Adam\\'s headset, muffling the shots so that he hears \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" playing instead. While this happens, an officer can be heard on megaphone ordering the inhabitants to surrender.<br/><br/>In the living room, a SWAT officer smashes one of the skylights and rappels in, firing a submachine gun. Just before his feet hit the ground, Dietrich raises a shotgun and shoots him. As another agent fires a submachine gun from the roof, Archer grabs Adam and he and Sasha rush into the other room. Another SWAT officer rappels through the side window. One thug covers Archer, Adam and Sasha and fires his pistol to drive the officer back. Some other SWATs burst in through the front doors, but this thug dives to the ground and fires a submachine pistol, forcing them to retreat.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Dietrich uses his shotgun to shoot another SWAT officer on the second floor, sending the officer crashing through the railing. The officer lands on the lower level, dead, just feet from where Archer and Sasha have taken cover. Archer is shocked to see one of his own colleagues die in front of him. Sasha grabs the officer\\'s submachine gun and she and Archer start to run. As several more of Castor\\'s men burst in, Archer aims a pistol and yells at them to hold their fire. Surprisingly, the officers comply. Archer and Sasha then dive for cover as the officers fire on Dietrich. Dietrich picks them off with individual shotgun rounds. The other thugs then shoot at the officers in a vicious exchange of gunfire. An officer then rappels through a window near Archer. Archer kicks him back through the window, then when the officer swings back into the apartment, hits him across his visor, knocking him out.<br/><br/>Dietrich then yells to Archer to hand him Adam. As Sasha exchanges submachine gun fire with a SWAT officer, Archer hands Adam over to Dietrich, who takes him to the bedroom. The officer Sasha was shooting at is eventually hit several times and falls dead. She then rushes one of the other women up the stairs to safety. Another officer starts to pursue them, but Archer raises a pistol and shoots him in the knee, knocking him down.<br/><br/>As Adam rides the shootout out, we see a timelapse montage pass as the thugs and the SWAT officers exchange fire and \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" drowns out shouting and gunfire. Officers and thugs alike are both shot dead in the furious gun battle.<br/><br/>The montage ends when Archer grabs Adam from his hiding place just as an officer opens fire on him. Archer hands Adam over to Sasha, who rushes downstairs to the lobby. As she enters the lobby, Archer\\'s partner Buzz, wearing a balaclava, corners them with a pistol. She promptly kicks him and disarms him. Buzz climbs to his feet and prepares to fire on Sasha, when Archer suddenly collars him, puts a pistol to his head and orders him to drop his weapon. Instinctively, Buzz complies. Archer then spins him around, pulls off his balaclava, and is stunned to recognize him. Before he can explain anything to Buzz, he hears Dietrich approaching. Buzz tries to grab Archer\\'s pistol, but Archer swiftly disarms him and knocks him unconscious, then shoots the ground next to him just as Dietrich, who has just shot a few more SWAT officers, arrives.<br/><br/>Just then, they hear footsteps. Archer has his pistol drawn and sees Castor stealthily walking down a flight of steps. Castor raises his pistol and aims it at Archer. Detecting Sasha moving, he aims his gun in her direction. When he draws a bead on her, Dietrich notices and quickly moves in the way just as Castor fires. The bullet hits Dietrich in the side of his neck. Clutching the wound with his right hand, he tells Sasha to run and exchanges a quick kiss on the cheek before she goes. Archer arrives, but it\\'s too late to save Dietrich. Dietrich thanks Archer for the good times they had before he collapses and bleeds to death.<br/><br/>Archer grabs Dietrich\\'s submachine gun and heads into the front lobby. He gets a glimpse of Castor running through a back pathway. Archer raises his submachine gun and fires a burst at Castor, shattering several mirrors. There is a moment of silence, then in a mirror, Archer spots Castor running in the opposite direction, spins around, and fires another volley. There is complete silence as Archer drops his submachine gun and trades it for his pistol, while Castor backs up against the opposite side of the mirror panel and quips that he doesn\\'t know which he hates wearing worse: Archer\\'s face or his body. He offers to trade their faces back and surrender, but Archer replies \"You can\\'t give back what you\\'ve taken from me.\" Castor then decides to go to Plan B: kill each other.<br/><br/>Archer and Castor each train a pistol on their reflection, trained at the other. Both men open fire simultaneously, bullets shattering the glass. Archer suddenly is thrown, a bullet hitting him in the side. The two continue to exchange fire until Loomis arrives with a Commando rifle in hand. Loomis fires on Archer, driving Archer up the stairway and sending Castor diving for cover.<br/><br/>Up on the roof, Pollux sees Archer arrive. He climbs up onto a vent, while Archer climbs onto a rope dangling from a crane. As Pollux raises his pistol and prepares to shoot, Archer slams into him, sending Pollux flying before crashing through the skylight. Down below, Castor takes cover as Pollux and lots of glass shards come plummeting towards him. Castor looks up, sees Archer dangling, and fires several rounds, sending Archer fleeing.<br/><br/>Castor then looks down and sees Pollux lying on the ground, dead. He immediately breaks down crying. Suddenly Loomis appears, and not knowing that he\\'s talking to Castor, he asks him why he is shedding tears for the likes of Pollux Troy. Castor snaps with rage, raises his pistol and promptly shoots Loomis in the face. Castor then takes notice of Pollux\\'s untied shoelaces. In brotherly fashion, he delicately reties Pollux\\'s shoes and departs.<br/><br/>The next morning, Castor returns to his office, dazed. He blows off his secretary as she informs him that he has made TIME Magazine\\'s \"Man of the Year\" segment, then sits down in his office chair to brood about Pollux\\'s death. Seconds later, an agitated Lazarro comes in to inform him that after the unnecessary carnage from his shootout with Archer at Dietrich\\'s apartment, he\\'s terminating Castor\\'s war on crime. Lazarro fails to see a hint of anger suddenly flash across Castor\\'s face as he queries as to how Castor happens to suddenly know so much about his own men\\'s movements. Seeing Lazarro clutch his chest from palpitations, Castor stands up, checks to make sure no one in the office is looking, and admits to Lazarro that he\\'ll give the taxpayers a break, but he has something he wants to confess to Lazarro, something he knows the director won\\'t like. He promptly snarls into Lazarro\\'s ear his true identity, then knocks Lazarro to the ground with a cut to the back of the neck. As Lazarro lies on the floor, Castor punches him in the heart hard enough that it stops completely. Collecting himself, Castor calls his secretary to tell her that Lazarro has just suffered a fatal heart attack.<br/><br/>Archer, meanwhile, breaks into his own house, narrowly avoiding the police officers that Castor has had placed outside to watch for him, and enters as Eve is coming out of the shower. Eve naturally does not take it easily seeing her husband\\'s worst enemy\\'s face, but Archer is able to keep her from making any noise that could attract the attention of the police officers in the house. He explains to her the exact details of the assignment he had been sent away on, how he was given Castor\\'s face through plastic surgery to get information about one of Castor\\'s crimes. After telling her what has happened, he admits that while she doesn\\'t have to believe a word he says, there is one way Eve can validate Archer\\'s claims: Archer\\'s blood type is O+ and Castor\\'s blood type is AB-.<br/><br/>When Castor comes home from work that night, he finds Eve working at her computer. He notices that she is looking tense and realizes that Archer has visited her and told her about him. Once Castor is asleep, Eve quietly and stealthily injects a needle into his left arm and draws some of his blood. She then sneaks out of the house and drives over to the hospital. Once there, she puts a couple of blood drops onto a plate and runs it through a hemoglobin test. She gasps as the results come back that say her sample is AB-, meaning she has been sleeping with Castor. Just then, Archer comes into the room, still clutching the bullet wound Castor gave him at Dietrich\\'s apartment. Eve suddenly draws a revolver on him, saying she doesn\\'t know who to trust. Archer realizes that she\\'s holding his backup service weapon. Although Eve still appears skeptical of Archer\\'s story, once he tells her the story of how they had their first kiss, she eventually realizes the truth. However, once all this is done, Archer promises to make it up to her and Jamie for all the neglect of emotions he put them through.<br/><br/>Eve then sets forth on stitching up Archer\\'s wound in the emergency room. Archer is aware that Lazarro has died, and also knows that the chain of succession means that he technically becomes the new acting director of the Los Angeles field office. As Castor is in Archer\\'s place, that makes him virtually untouchable. Eve tells him that won\\'t be the case the next day, as Castor will be at Lazarro\\'s funeral. Archer tells Eve to get herself and Jamie away from Castor as soon as possible. Eve is not sure, as she can handle an excuse for Jamie, but she\\'s expected to go to the funeral as well, and if Castor doesn\\'t see her, he will be suspicious. Almost as if on cue, there is a commotion outside. Aware that Eve has snuck out, Castor has arrived with Leo and Lars and is scouring the hospital looking for Archer. Eve quickly hides Archer as Castor pulls back curtain after curtain looking for his foe. When he pulls back the curtains around Eve, to his disappointment he finds her apparently in the middle of attending to a burn patient. She makes up a story about being on-call for that night. Castor apparently accepts her story and departs with his thugs. Once out of earshot from Eve, Castor quips, \"Lies, deceit, mixed messages... this is turning into a real marriage.\"<br/><br/>The next day, Sasha and Archer track Castor to Lazarro\\'s funeral, where Castor is holding Archer\\'s wife and daughter Jamie hostage. Castor reveals that Michael\\'s death was an accident and he was trying to kill Archer himself. However, he took it personally and advises him to either kill himself or let it go. Archer tells him no father would let go until the one responsible paid for it with his life. Castor replies neither would a brother. Sasha retorts not even a sister and gives Archer (as Castor) the gun. With Eve caught in the middle, everyone is engaged in a Mexican standoff. A gunfight then ensues in which Sasha and all of Castor\\'s minions are killed. Having taken a bullet to save Archer, Sasha begs him not to let Adam grow up to be a criminal. Archer agrees to keep his promise to her as she dies in his arms and Eve feels sorry for her.<br/><br/>Castor and Archer engage in both a gun battle and hand-to-hand fight, with Archer gaining the upper hand. Jamie finds a gun and shoots at Archer (as Castor), believing him to be the real Castor, and wounds him in the shoulder, allowing the real Castor to break free. He takes Jamie as his hostage and licks her face as he mentions peaches. However, she gets him to let her go by stabbing him in the leg with the balisong, ironically a trick which he taught her earlier himself. Eve comforts her as Castor makes his escape by shooting two FBI members as Archer pursues him.<br/><br/>Castor manages to escape in a boat, pursued by Archer. After a lengthy chase both Archer and Castor\\'s boats are destroyed and they are thrown ashore by an explosion resulting from their boats\\' collisions. The two engage in a final hand-to-hand confrontation which results in Archer eventually prevailing by killing Castor with a spear gun, (which leaves Castor in the same position as the statue shown earlier of Jesus on the cross) but not before Castor tries to destroy Archer\\'s face (on himself) to prevent Archer reclaiming it.<br/><br/>Eve is able to explain the entire situation to the FBI and successfully convince them of Archer\\'s true identity. Archer is then taken to the hospital where a team of Washington D.C.\\'s finest doctors does his surgery and his face is restored, with the exception of his chest scar which served as a reminder of the loss of his son as he doesn\\'t \"need it anymore\", due to Castor\\'s death.<br/><br/>After the restoration surgery, Archer (once again played by John Travolta) now wearing his original face and voice, comes home and hugs Eve and Jamie. Jamie apologizes for shooting him, but he tells her that she made the right decison because her bullet actually disloged the vocal microphone that turned his voice into Castor\\'s. He is proud of the way she stood up to Castor when she stabbed him on his leg. Soon after, he brings Adam Hassler, Castor\\'s son with Sasha, into his family, in order to fulfill his promise to her in not allowing him to grow up as criminal. Jamie acccepts him as her new brother and shows him to his new room. Eve agrees to adopt him with Sean, knowing that Michael has moved on and Adam can use a new home.</div></div>'}\n",

However, a mysterious new adversary in the person of the determined and silver-tongued psychiatrist, Dr Ellie Staple, has made it her mission to convince David, Kevin, and Raven Hill Memorial\\'s wheel-bound brittle-boned inmate, Elijah Price, that the delusional super-humans are, in fact, mere mortals. Now, the stage seems set for the ultimate revelation, against the backdrop of an imminent deadly confrontation.

After apprehending two male delinquents who have assaulted a man for views on the internet, Dunn returns to his business of \"Dunn Home Security\". It is revealed that he is hunting after Kevin Wendell Crumb/The Horde/The Beast after his exploits in <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/title/tt4972582/?ref_=ttpl\">Split (2016)</a>, which in this film occurred three weeks ago. Upon returning home, David struggles with the fact that his wife left him, not able to cope with her husband\\'s superhuman exploits and beliefs.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kevin Wendell Crumb/The Horde has kidnapped a small group of cheerleaders and holds them hostage, preparing to feed them to the Beast in an abandoned factory. Dunn walks through the streets the next morning, brushing against people who pass him by in the crowds in order to see into their past and deduce who the Beast is. He brushes against the nine-year-old personality of Kevin and sees a flashback of him speaking to corpses of young women his ego the Beast had just killed. That night, while Kevin transforms into the Beast and presumably attacks a group of homeless people, Dunn dons the rain-slicker overcoat of the Overseer and arrives at the factory. After freeing the girls, he is attacked by the Beast who is quicker and more agile than him. But Overseer is stronger than the Beast, and when the Beast attempts to crush him, Overseer leaps out of a nearby window, causing them both to land in the streets below.<br/><br/>The two rise up and charge each other once more but are stopped by a group of police led by a mysterious woman who encourages Dunn to give himself up to avoid hurting officers of the law. The Beast is reduced to a confused and scared Kevin by the flashing lights that the police have. The two are then arrested and brought to Raven Hill Memorial Institution. Joseph watches helplessly as his father and Kevin are placed in holding cells. Dunn is placed in a room with water sprinklers which will go off if he attempts to escape. Kevin is held in a room with hypnosis lights meant to flash should he ever show outright forms of violence. Also at Raven Hill is Elijah Price, still serving his time for bombing the Eastrail 177 in order to find David Dunn and discover his powers of physical invincibility. The mysterious woman from earlier reveals herself to be Dr. Ellie Staple, a psychiatrist.<br/><br/>Ellie Staple tries to convince the men that they are normal people with compulsions of grandeur but consistently fails. She then tries to appeal to Price\\'s mother, Joseph Dunn, and Casey Cooke, former victim and friend of Kevin, but fails again. Staple gives the men three days to be convinced that they are deluded figures and not superhumans, otherwise they will be brought to trial for their crimes. Staple then calls Dunn and Kevin into a room to test their psyches. However, a seemingly dormant and unresponsive Elijah Price (still wheelchair-bound from the broken spine he received from his fall down a flight of stairs in <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/title/tt0217869/?ref_=ttpl\">Unbreakable (2000)</a>) is wheeled in and brought alongside the men, much to David Dunn\\'s disgust in being associated with him. During the meeting, Staple recalls Kevin\\'s past abuse from his mother which spurred the transformation of the Horde, as well as the time David was nearly drowned in a swimming pool which nearly killed him--the first time water was revealed to be his kryptonite. She then tests Price\\'s psyche by recalling a time in which he broke his arm on a ride at a carnival, bringing to mind the extreme fragility of his bones.<br/><br/>Later that night, Elijah Price breaks free from his cell and meets with Kevin who is in his \"Patricia\" personality. After an intelligent discussion, Elijah Price reveals that he has not been taking his sedative medication, instead hiding it inside his wheelchair, thus keeping his wits about him and remaining sharp as ever. He encourages Kevin/Patricia to meet with him the next night and show him the \"Beast.\" Before Price leaves, Kevin/Patricia asks what his name is. Price turns his head and replies, \"First name Mister...Last name...Glass.\"<br/><br/>Upon returning to his room, Price is captured by Staple who performs a pre-frontal lobotomy on him knowing that his genius must be quelled before he can put any plan into motion. The seemingly brain-dead Price is brought back to his cell but suddenly comes alive and kills his caretaker by slashing his throat with a shard of broken glass. It is then revealed that Price had planned to be caught by Staple, and had sabotaged the machine earlier should the operation be conducted on him. Price then escapes to Kevin\\'s cell and deactivates the \"hypnotic lights.\" He and Kevin make their way to a secret room where Kevin transforms into the Beast and looks over Price, discovering that he has been broken. The Beast immediately takes a liking to Price but not before Price explains his plan to have the Beast and the Overseer battle each other at the top of the just-erected highest skyscraper in the city of Philadelphia. It is there that the whole world will see and discover that superheroes do indeed exist. The Beast agrees and helps Price make his way through the facility.<br/><br/>Price then communicates with David in his cell and explains that he had deactivated the water sprinklers. He encourages David to escape but David initially refuses. Price then explains that should David refuse to escape and fight the Beast, Price will blow up a chemical company, killing many people. Having no other choice, David reluctantly breaks down the door, dons his rain slicker, and runs out of the institution.<br/><br/>Price and Beast begin by confronting an orderly who had maltreated Price years earlier. The Beast crushes the orderly and forces him to kneel before Price before beating him to death as Price watches, shaking his head at the man\\'s stubbornness. The Beast then wheels Price through the halls, beating down every security force that tries to hinder them. The Beast captures two nurses and forces them into a van where he keeps them hostage. Two police officers show up but the Beast makes short work of them.<br/><br/>Price\\'s mother, Joseph, and Casey arrive in time to see the Beast notice the Overseer approaching. Price sits back in his wheelchair and watches in excitement as the Beast charges Overseer and the two engage in a fight. Staple also sees this and calls up security. Casey rushes out, hoping to calm Kevin down but he is too busy fighting Overseer. Price recognizes her as \"the one the Beast let go\" and smiles in fascination at her. Armed police arrive and separate Overseer from the Beast, but are quickly overpowered. Overseer manages to push the forces attacking him into an enclosed compartment before locking them in while the Beast manages to kill and eat some of his attackers. Overseer frees the nurses the Beast held hostage before being attacked by the Beast. Price had informed the Beast that the Overseer\\'s weakness is water and directed him to a water tank the institution uses.<br/><br/>Joseph intervenes and explains to Kevin that Kevin\\'s father was on the Eastrail 177 as well which Price had destroyed, thus killing Kevin\\'s father and creating the Beast. Upon hearing this, Price is overcome with delight and amazement upon realizing he created both a superhero and a supervillain, and declares himself a mastermind. The Beast thanks Price for creating him, but then explains that he must protect Kevin at all costs--right before breaking Price\\'s collarbone. Overseer tries to distract Beast from Price, saying that his fight is with him, which Price finds amusing. The Beast then punches Price in the chest, breaking his ribs which in turn pierce his lungs and mortally wound him. Price exclaims with pain and falls out of his wheelchair, dying upon the ground.<br/><br/>The Beast flings Overseer/David Dunn into the water tank and fights him in there, easily overpowering him. Dunn manages to break through the wall and the two splash out onto the institution\\'s lawn. The water from the tank pours out as well and fills a nearby pothole. The Beast says to Dunn that they will finish their battle at the top of the skyscraper and begins running off in that direction. Staple convinces Casey to calm the Beast down to avoid any other violence and she agrees. Casey catches up to the Beast and appeals to him, causing him to calm down and revert to the innocent Kevin. Once his defenses are down, a sniper shoots Kevin in the stomach now that the bulletproof skin of the Beast is gone. Kevin bleeds out and begins dying.<br/><br/>More police forces show up and Joseph asks them to help his father as he is very weak. One of the security forces grabs David and drags him over to the water-filled pothole, forcibly drowning his face in it. David is too weak to fight back and is easily overcome. Staple arrives and orders the guard to wait as she grabs David\\'s hand. He then sees a flashback to her life in which she is a member of a secret society monitoring the actions and works of superhuman beings, quelling them should they draw too much attention. She tells David that if she convinced him he was human she would have let him live, but Price\\'s and the Beast\\'s machinations prevented that. She then leaves and David realizes his true insignificance as the guard repeatedly bashes David\\'s face into the puddle, ruthlessly drowning him.<br/><br/>Kevin dies in Casey\\'s arms, finally finding the light and finding peace in the safety of his friend\\'s arms. Elijah lays dying in the parking lot, a broken and pitiful mess. Staple arrives and tells him that she and members of her following have suppressed superhuman masterminds to retain a safe society preventing overarching divides of \"gods\" among men. After Staple leaves, Elijah Price\\'s mother kneels over her dying son. Price explains painfully that he was not a mistake to which his mother smiles proudly at him saying, \"No. You were spectacular.\" Price smiles wryly and dies peacefully.<br/><br/>Believing her mission a success, Staple deletes the footage of all the security cameras which recorded the fight between Overseer and Beast. However, upon closer examination she realizes that Price had hacked the computers and livestreamed all the events to a private network. Thus, it was never Price\\'s plan to escape the facility and force the Beast to battle Overseer at the top of the skyscraper, as such a plan would be too elaborate. His plan and everything he had worked for was now a complete success. Staple leaves the security room and screams in anger realizing her failure. Price\\'s mother, Joseph, and Casey receive copies of the footage and upload it, revealing it all to the public in the Philadelphia skyscraper. The film ends with them sitting together as the videos of Overseer and the Beast and their fantastic feats are relayed and spread to everyone\\'s feed and the daily news, revealing the world of superheroes to the public.<br/><br/>The main title of \"Glass\" appears on the screen one last time and the end credits are laced with shards of glass through which scenes from the film as well as the previous films of <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/title/tt0217869/?ref_=ttpl\">Unbreakable (2000)</a> and <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/title/tt4972582/?ref_=ttpl\">Split (2016)</a>, connecting the whole story together.</div></div>'}\n",

The bomb explodes.<br/><br/>The submarine surfaces and they lookout for signs on the surface. A large whirlpool starts and Godzilla comes out, the Titan comes close to the sub, peers closely, but leaves them alone then swims off. Back at Bravo, Mark wants to find Maddie and prepares to leave, but a bright light breaks through the rain, it is Mothra in all its glory.<br/><br/>Maddie has also realized her mother is crazy and tries to stop her. Emma realizes they can use Boston\\'s Fenway Park to send out a ORCA signal stopping the Titans, Col. Alan says no, they must see through the plan, even though Ghidorah\\'s powers were more than expected.<br/><br/>Maddie escapes the Monarch bunker, an old fallout shelter, with the Orcaa device. She makes her way to Fenway Park and plugs the equipment into the PA system, then starts broadcasting a signal.<br/><br/>The Titans around the world stop, Ghidorah\\'s goes toward Boston to find the signal.\\nIt arrives in a hurricane and blasts the PA speakers, then looks into the stadium windows seeing Maddie.

Marty is forced to sell his motel to Barry Nottingham who promises to hire Skeeter in a general manager position when he has grown up. Years later, Barry builds a new hotel; forgets his promise to Marty; and Skeeter Bronson is only the handyman of his hotel.

The story is about himself as the owner of a quaint hotel that is also run by himself and his 2 children. The daughter (Abigail Droeger), at 12 years old is very serious minded and runs the front desk efficiently. And the son (Thomas Hoffman), at 10 years old, has a wondrous imagination that will take him anywhere, but is absolutely, totally, completely, utterly, &amp; entirely useless to the hotel. Little do the children know, though, that the motel is in debt, and Marty is forced to sell to an English chap by the name of Barry Nottingham (Richard Griffiths). However, Marty will only sell to Barry under the agreement that his son run the place when he is of age.<br/><br/>Fast forward and we see the quaint hotel quadrupled in size and is no longer a family establishment but more for the rich and famous, and Marty\\'s son Skeeter Bronson (Adam Sandler) is the hotel handyman. When Nottingham announces plans to build a new hotel he appoints another man named Kendall (Guy Pearce) to become the manager.<br/><br/>After work, Skeeter visits his sister for it is his niece\\'s birthday (who he hasn\\'t seen in 4 years). There his sister Wendy (Courteney Cox) informs him that the school that the children Patrick (Jonathan Morgan Heit) and Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling) attend, which she herself is the principal at, is being closed down and that has to relocate to Arizona for a job and asks Skeeter if he could watch her kids while she goes for an interview. Even though Skeeter doesn\\'t know his niece and nephew very well, he agrees.<br/><br/>After the day shift babysitter Jill (Keri Russell) leaves, he settles them into bed and they ask him to read a story. After looking at the lame books that the children have, he refuses to read them and instead makes up his own story. Modeled around his own life, he tells the story of a medieval squire named \"Sir Fixalot\" and his rival \"Sir Buttkiss\". Throughout the story the kids make their own additions, such as the king giving Sir Fixalot a chance to prove himself. During the celebration, Patrick announces that \"it starts raining gumballs\" and the story ends.<br/><br/>The following day, Skeeter is called to fix Nottingham\\'s television and during the visit, Nottingham tells Skeeter the \"secret\" theme that he had announced for the hotel - a rock and roll theme much like that of the Hard Rock Hotel. When Skeeter points out this has been done before he is offered the opportunity to compete with Kendall \"to prove himself\" for a better theme. While driving to his sister\\'s house, Skeeter is suddenly greeted with a shower of gumballs raining down from above (which he does not see is caused by a crashed delivery truck). Skeeter concludes that the story has come true and quickly develops a plan to use it to his advantage.<br/><br/>For the next story, he elaborates a Western theme in which he receives a free \"Ferrari\" horse from a Native American chief. The children do not corroborate the story, but have him save a damsel in distress from several criminals. They claim he should be rewarded with a kiss, but an angry dwarf kicks him instead. That night, Skeeter goes out in search of his Ferrari and meets a Native American man who steals his wallet. Later, Violet who is being hounded by paparazzi, is rescued by the passing Skeeter. Just as he is about to kiss her, he is kicked by an angry dwarf from a nearby fraternity.<br/><br/>From this point, he determines that it is only the changes made by the children that actually affect reality. The following night, Skeeter tries to sell the kids on the theme ideas contest, but they are more interested in romance and action in their stories. The next story begins with Skeetacus, a Greek gladiator who, after impressing the emperor and a stadium of onlookers, attracts the attention of the \"fairest maiden\". He and the maiden walk into a restaurant where all the girls who were mean to him growing up are sitting at a table, they are to be so impressed by the maiden he is with, they start to nervously sing the \"Hokey Pokey\". After a meal they go for a walk on the beach where a large hairy man who is having trouble breathing is washed up on the shore, and after Skeetacus saves this man\\'s life, a rainstorm sends him and the maiden into a magical cave which has Abraham Lincoln in it. Skeeter loses his patience with the story and upsets the children. Unable to get them to continue, the story ends.<br/><br/>The next day, Skeeter learns that Violet will not be meeting with him as he thought, but unexpectedly runs into Jill, who invites him to lunch. The girls from Skeeter\\'s high school are at the restaurant, so Skeeter asks Jill to pretend to be his girlfriend. After the girls break into the \"Hokey Pokey\" and Skeeter casually saves the life of a man on the beach, a sudden rainstorm sends them under the dock and he realizes that he is falling in love with her. But the kiss he is about to receive is interrupted as he is reminded about the Abraham Lincoln part of the story as someone walks on the dock above them, and thinking that the real \"Abe\" is going to appear he ducks. Instead a penny falls through the dock.<br/><br/>For Skeeter and the kids\\' final night together, a space-themed story begins with Skeeter\\'s character who battles Kendall\\'s character in anti-gravity. Skeeter\\'s hard-to-understand character wins and Skeeter quickly ends the story. Patrick interjects that the story is too predictable and says that Skeeter is then \\'incinertated\\' before ending the story.<br/><br/>At Nottingham\\'s birthday party, among the fiery hazards that Skeeter is trying to avoid, his tongue is stung by a bee, making him hard to understand when competing with Kendall\\'s new Broadway-themed hotel. Nottingham enjoys Skeeter\\'s approach over the showy approach that Kendall had provided. A panic attack on a fiery birthday cake causes Skeeter to be \"fired\" by Nottingham. Afterward Jill, Patrick, and Bobbi are all upset as they learned where, which Skeeter had just discovered, the hotel was going to be built: on the property of the school which they all work and attend. Wendy believes he did not know, but is upset because he had inadvertently taught the children there are no such things as happy endings. When they attend the demolition to protest, Skeeter is inspired to prevent the school from being demolished. After finding Nottingham an alternative location, Skeeter takes Jill on a wild motorcycle ride which ends at the school and manages to stop the countdown. Sometime later, he marries Jill and founds a hotel named after his late father. Kendall and his scheming partner Aspen (Lucy Lawless) are demoted to Skeeter\\'s hotel waiting staff.</div></div>'}\n",

They discover the strange sounds are actually the songs of the humpback whale - which has been hunted to extinction. They have only one choice - to attempt to time travel back into the 20th century, locate two whales, and bring them back to 23rd century Earth to respond to the probe.<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=Colin%20Tinto%20%3Ccst%40imdb.com%3E&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_3\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Colin Tinto &lt;cst@imdb.com&gt;</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">In this, the final episode of the trilogy that began with <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/title/tt0084726/?ref_=ttpl\">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982)</a>, the crew of the Enterprise leaves Vulcan after three months of exile, having voted to return to Earth to face charges for their actions in <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/title/tt0088170/?ref_=ttpl\">Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984)</a>. They depart for Earth on the Klingon Bird-of-Prey they captured from Commander Kruge on the Genesis Planet, now rechristened by Dr. McCoy as the \"HMS Bounty\". After performing modifications to their new craft, the crew take off and head for Earth.<br/><br/>Having had his katra successfully returned to his body, Spock has been in rigorous training sessions to restore his mind. He is able to answer many rapid-fire questions on Vulcan history, science and philosophy but when the testing computer robotically asks him \"How do you feel?\" Spock doesn\\'t know the answer. His mother, Amanda, informs him that part of the retraining of his mind also involves the human component, which is guided by emotion. She bids him to seek the answer when he leaves with Kirk and the rest of his shipmates. Spock is reinstated as the craft\\'s science officer, a move by Kirk which is questioned by McCoy, who thinks Spock isn\\'t fully up to the challenge.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, an alien probe of unknown origin is also on course for Earth. As it travels, it emits a strange signal that disables all of the technology that it encounters, leaving a trail of damaged and powerless starships and starbases in its wake. Upon its arrival on Earth, the planet itself is jeopardized as high technology fails, the oceans are evaporated, and the atmosphere is ionized. Clouds block out the sun, which Earth cannot survive without. Violent storms break out across the Earth\\'s surface, threatening all of humanity and severely disabling all communications.<br/><br/>Arriving within our solar system, the Bounty crew receives a distress transmission from the Federation President on Earth who informs them that all craft must stay away from Earth. The Bounty crew analyzes the strange signals from the probe and realizes they are those of whale song, an apparent attempt to communicate with the humpback whales that formerly lived in Earth\\'s oceans but were hunted to extinction in the 21st Century. Kirk asks Spock if the whales song could be simulated, however the language could not be duplicated and a response would only sound like gibberish. The crew decides that the only way to answer the probe\\'s signals is to travel back in time and obtain humpback whales. Kirk orders Spock to begin calculations for time travel and has the Enterprise\\'s chief engineer, Mr. Scott, plan to enclose part of the ship\\'s cargo hold to serve as a storage and transport tank for the whales. Kirk is able to send a final communication to Starfleet on Earth informing them of their plan but it is quickly disrupted by the extreme weather patterns.<br/><br/>Using the slingshot-around-the-sun maneuver first developed on the television series, they take the Bounty back to 20th Century Earth where two humpback whales are detected in the vicinity of San Francisco. Cloaked, the Bounty lands in Golden Gate Park, but the strain of time travel has depleted her energy source of dilithium crystals and they must find a way to re-energize them. Spock suggests that since nuclear fission still exists as a power source in the 20th Century, they may be able to capture nuclear particles to rebuild the dilithium crystals.<br/><br/>Once in the city, the crew separates to accomplish three different missions: Locate the whales, build a tank within the Bounty that can carry the humpback whales, and locate a source of high-energy photons with which the crystals can be regenerated. Kirk (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000638/?ref_=ttpl\">William Shatner</a>) and Spock (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000559/?ref_=ttpl\">Leonard Nimoy</a>) will locate the whales, Dr. McCoy (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0001420/?ref_=ttpl\">DeForest Kelley</a>), Scotty (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0001150/?ref_=ttpl\">James Doohan</a>) and Sulu (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0001786/?ref_=ttpl\">George Takei</a>) will find materials to build the tank and Chekov (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000479/?ref_=ttpl\">Walter Koenig</a>) and Uhura (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0629667/?ref_=ttpl\">Nichelle Nichols</a>) will find a nuclear energy source to repair the dilithium core. The team finds their way into downtown San Francisco and discover that society of the 20th Century is still using money. Kirk sells the antique eyeglasses given to him by McCoy to an antique dealer for $100 and splits the money between himself and the other teams.<br/><br/>Kirk and Spock go in search of the two whales, locating them at Sausalito\\'s Cetacean Institute (a redress of the Monterey Bay Aquarium). There, they encounter Dr. Gillian Taylor (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0382819/?ref_=ttpl\">Catherine Hicks</a>), the assistant director of the Institute and keeper of the whales who are named George and Gracie. During a regular tour Gillian mentions that the whales will soon be returned to the ocean since the institute can\\'t afford to keep them in captivity. Gillian also says she\\'s grown quite attached to them, as they are gentle, friendly and intelligent animals. Spock dives into the whale tank and mind-melds with one of the whales, but is caught in the act and Kirk and Spock are ejected from the Institute. Walking along Marine Drive in San Francisco, Spock explains that he believes he was successfully explaining their intentions to the whales and that they communicated to him their unhappiness at their treatment by humans. The pair are found by Dr. Taylor and given a ride to Golden Gate Park to drop off Spock. While she drives them there, she asks them questions about their interest in the whales. Spock reveals that Gracie is pregnant and she stops her truck suddenly, somewhat upset and astonished that Spock would know such a fact. To smooth over the tense situation, Kirk suggests that they go to lunch.<br/><br/>Kirk goes to an Italian restaurant with Gillian and eventually informs her part of his plan--he does not divulge that the whales are needed to save Earth in the future; he informs her that he is attempting to repopulate the species. Gillian is incredulous but skeptical. Kirk asks her for the radio frequency of the transmitter the whales will be tagged with and she avoids the question. However, she does reveal that the whales are to be released into the ocean at noon the next day. Kirk suddenly realizes that he is on a much tighter timeline than he figured. When Gillian drops off Kirk at Golden Gate Park and he asks her for the radio frequency, she still refuses to turn it over. As she drives away, she just misses him being beamed back onto the Klingon warbird.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Dr. McCoy and Scotty set off in search of material suitable for creating a transparent tank wall on the warbird. Since transparent aluminum hasn\\'t been invented yet, they will have to make due with plastic. At a large company called Plexicorp, they use the formula for transparent aluminum as a bribe to obtain the material they need from the plant\\'s chief researcher, Dr. Nichols (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0378261/?ref_=ttpl\">Alex Henteloff</a>). Sulu acquires a military helicopter to transport it back to the Bounty. Finally, Uhura and Chekov go to the Alameda Naval Station to obtain high-energy photons from the reactor of a nuclear \"wessel\" (which turns out to be the USS Enterprise aircraft carrier). The photons are obtained and Uhura is able to return to the Bounty when Scotty\\'s transporter energy is reduced to minimal, but Chekov is captured and interrogated by naval investigators. Attempting escape, he falls, is seriously injured, and is taken to Mercy Hospital.<br/><br/>Overnight, at the Cetacean Institute, the whales have been released, owing to Gracie\\'s advanced pregnancy, and that Gillian\\'s boss thinking it would be easier on her. She furiously slaps her boss and rushes back to Golden Gate Park where she sees Sulu\\'s helicopter lowering the plastic wall into thin air, the cloaked Klingon warbird. Shouting for help, she is beamed aboard, confirming Kirk\\'s story of the previous evening. She is rather overwhelmed but informs Kirk about the whales being let loose during the night. Uhura is able to locate Chekov; McCoy gravely informs Kirk that they cannot leave Chekov behind and at the mercy of 20th Century medicine. Spock concurs, saying that rescuing Chekov, while a potential impediment to their mission, is the human thing to do.<br/><br/>Together, she, Kirk and McCoy rescue Chekov from the hospital. McCoy (after curing a elderly woman\\'s kidney dialysis with a single pill) argues briefly with the 20th Century doctor, who plans to drill into Chekov\\'s skull to relieve pressure from hemorrhaging. McCoy insists that the damaged artery in Chekov\\'s skull should be repaired first and scoffs the \"medieval\" equipment and techniques of 20th Century medicine. Kirk breaks up the argument by locking the doctor and his staff in a small room and McCoy sets about healing Chekov. They exit the OR and are chased by the police guarding Chekov and beam out of the hospital to Golden Gate Park from inside an elevator. They board and the warbird leaves immediately to recapture the whales from the open sea. The whales are swimming in the Gulf of Alaska and about to be harpooned by a whaling vessel when the warbird decloaks, scaring off the hunters. The extra weight of both the whales and the water that were beamed aboard the Bounty create a new problem: the added mass will make their time travel more difficult. Spock is able to alter their trajectory around the sun and they successfully time warp back to the 23rd Century.<br/><br/>However, the ship is immediately rendered powerless by the probe and crash-lands in San Francisco Bay near the Golden Gate Bridge. Freed into the ocean, the whales respond to the probe and it is finally satisfied, halting the transmission of its dangerous signal and allowing the Earth to survive. The probe leaves Earth and the crew of the Bounty celebrate in the water as the whales swim off into the Pacific.<br/><br/>A brief trial is then held for the crew of the HMS Bounty. Though Spock does not stand accused, he stands with his crewmates as a show of solidarity and gratitude. The charges are serious: conspiracy, assaulting Federation officers, theft of Federation property (the Enterprise), sabotage of the USS Excelsior, willful destruction of Federation property (the Enterprise again), and disobeying direct orders. When asked how they will plead, Kirk answers for everyone, saying they plead guilty. However, as a result of having saved the planet yet again as pointed out by the Federation President, the Federation and Starfleet officials are predisposed towards lenience. All charges arising from their actions in rescuing Spock from Genesis are summarily dropped, save disobeying orders from a superior officer, directed solely at Kirk. The charge results in him being busted down in rank from Admiral to Captain (which they are fully aware he preferred anyway) and he is once again assigned the command of a starship. The President also says that Kirk and his crew saved Earth from its own short-sightedness and its people are forever in their debt.<br/><br/>At the trial\\'s conclusion, Kirk and Gillian part ways, as she has been assigned to a science vessel by Starfleet, since she has begun three hundred years of catch-up learning. Spock meets his father who confesses that he was wrong opposing his son\\'s decision to join Starfleet: he has done his father proud and has friends of good character. At the end, Sarek asks if Spock has any message for his mother, Spock just says that he feels fine. At Spacedock, the crew speculates that they may command a freighter while Sulu hopes for the USS Excelsior. However, they soon learn that they are assigned a newly christened starship; the USS Enterprise-A, a duplicate of the earlier Enterprise. Now at home with a new ship, the crew sets out for a shakedown mission.</div></div>'}\n",

The woman, Chani, is a Fremen. She explains that since before she was born the planet has been ruled by the cruel Harkonnens who have grown enormously rich harvesting the psychogenic substance \"melange\" also known as the spice. The Fremen have been trying to expel the Harkonnens, but to no avail. Recently, however, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV has ordered the Harkonnens to leave Arrakis. Chani wonders who the new rulers will be.<br/><br/>On the planet Caladan, Paul Atreides eats breakfast with his mother, Lady Jessica, Duke Leto\\'s concubine. A member of the quasi-religious order of the Bene Gesserit, Jessica has been trying to teach her son the special powers of her order. She tests Paul by having him try to compel her to pass him a glass of water. Paul is only partially successful. Paul learns about the planet Arrakis and its people. It is the only source of the psychoactive spice, which extends life and perception. Spice is necessary for interstellar travel since it makes possible the expanded consciousness of the navigators who plot faster than light jumps, \"folding\" space time to travel instantly from one planet to another.<br/><br/>Leto Atreides, along with soldier Gurney Halleck and mentat Thufir Hawat, receive an imperial envoy who formalizes the awarding of Arrakis to House Atreides. The emperor fears Leto\\'s growing political power and popularity in the Landsraad, a conclave of noble houses. Leto recognizes that his appointment to oversee Arrakis is a trap of some kind, but cannot refuse an imperial offer. Paul asks his friend, the elite soldier Duncan Idaho to take him along when Duncan goes to Arrakis weeks ahead of time to scout things out. Duncan refuses. Paul confides that he\\'s been having dreams about Arrakis and the Fremen, including one where Duncan falls in battle. Duncan dismisses this as merely a dream, telling Paul that \"Everything important happens when we\\'re awake\".<br/><br/>Paul discusses his wish to travel to Arrakis early with his father, but Leto refuses, saying that he needs Paul by his side. He explains the political situation: the emperor has set up a conflict between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, a war which will weaken them both, to the benefit of the Emperor. Leto instead intends to strike an alliance with the Fremen in order to harness their \"desert power\" to his own and outwit the Emperor. Paul expresses his doubts about his ability to succeed his father as a leader. Leto confides his own doubts when he was young and insists that Paul will find his way to leadership, just as he did.<br/><br/>Gurney has a sparring session with Paul, insisting that the young ducal heir must be more wary about the danger posed by the Harkonnens and more ruthless in battle. Paul begins to have dreams of Chani. Jessica\\'s Bene Gesserit superior, Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam arrives on Caladan to test Paul. Before the meeting he is inspected by Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, who warns Paul that the Bene Gesserit have their own agenda. Mohiam puts Paul through the test of the Gom Jabbar, using a poisoned needle and a pain-inflicting box to judge his character. After the test, Mohiam asks Paul about his dreams and whether they sometimes come true. Afterward, Mohiam berates Jessica for producing a son for Duke Leto, rather than the daughters she had been ordered to produce.<br/><br/>She accuses Jessica of thinking that her son might be the Kwisatz Haderach, the fulfillment of a Bene Gesserit messianic prophecy. Jessica confirms this belief and Mohiam warns her that Paul\\'s abilities are not fully developed and that he might die in the coming trials. When Mohiam leaves, Paul confronts his mother about what Mohiam meant. Jessica explains that the Bene Gesserit have spent hundreds of years engaged in a selective breeding program to produce an unparalleled mind who can see both the past and the future.<br/><br/>The Atreides arrive on Arrakis. When they disembark their ship, locals begin chanting a phrase Paul cannot recognize. Paul asks his mother and she explains that it\\'s a local prophecy of the Lisan-al-Gaib, the \"voice from outer world\", a prophesied messiah on Arrakis. Jessica says that they think Paul might be this figure, but Paul dismisses it as mere superstition spread by the Bene Gesserit. Jessica hires a Fremen servant, Shadout Mapes. Mapes sees Jessica and Paul as a fulfillment of the Lisan-al-Gaib and gives Jessica a dagger made from the tooth of Shai-halud, the immense sandworms which make the desert of Arrakis so dangerous. That night, while he studies a holographic image of the muad\\'Dib desert mouse, Paul survives an assassination attempt by a hunter seeker drone when Mapes enters the room, distracting it.<br/><br/>Leto surveys his new domain and discovers that the Harkonnens have sabotaged much of the needed infrastructure. They decide to take the issue to the imperial arbiter of the transition, an ecologist named Liet Kynes, who has resided on Arrakis for years. Duncan Idaho returns from several weeks living with the Fremen. He reports to the Duke that the Fremen are unparalleled fighters who live in communities known as \"sietchs\" in caverns beneath the desert. Duncan confirms Thufir Hawat\\'s belief that there are many more Fremen than previously believed. The leader of one of these sietchs, Stilgar, has come to meet with Leto. Stilgar demands that the outworlders not travel beyond the city except to mine spice. Leto refuses but insists that the sietchs will remain inviolate and that Fremen will not be hunted while the Atreides rule. Paul invites Stilgar to stay, but he leaves. Duncan introduces the Atreides to some Fremen technology, including the moisture saving stillsuits and thumpers which are used to attract sandworms.<br/><br/>Leto\\'s party meets with Liet Kynes to investigate the spice mining operations. She inspects their stillsuits and finds that Paul has intuitively fitted his stillsuit in the Fremen manner. In the native language she says \"He shall know your ways as if born to them\". The party flies out to observe a spice mining operation. The mining vehicle -- a \"sandcrawler\" -- has attracted a worm, which is drawn by the rhythmic vibrations of the crawler as it collects the spice. When a flying carry-all fails to remove the mining vehicle, Duke Leto lands his small squad of ornithopters nearby to rescue the miners. When Paul gets out to guide the miners inside, he is hit with a massive dose of spice and has a series of visions including one of himself with Chani. He is nearly sucked down into the sand with the crawler when Gurney grabs him and hauls him aboard his father\\'s ornithopter. The two watch as the worm\\'s enormous, toothed maw opens and swallows the sandcrawler whole. Later, Paul is examined by Dr Yueh who informs Paul and his mother that the spice is psychoactive but shouldn\\'t harm Paul.<br/><br/>Duke Leto awakes at night with the sense that something is wrong. He calls security but gets no answer. He finds Mapes stabbed to death and is shot with a paralytic dart that burrows its way through his body shield and into his back, rendering him helpless. Yueh reveals himself as a traitor. He has lowered the shields and sabotaged Atreides communications. Yueh reveals to Leto that the Harkonnens secured his compliance because they have his wife held captive. He replaces one of Duke Leto\\'s teeth with a poison capsule which he hopes the Duke can use to kill the Baron.<br/><br/>Gurney is awakened and leads the counter attack as the Harkonnen forces, aided by the imperial Sardukar troops, begin their assault. The Atreides troops, caught unprepared and outnumbered by Harkonnen troops and the Sardukar, find themselves quickly overwhelmed. Duncan kills several Sardukar, takes an ornithopter and tries to rescue Paul and Jessica but finds them already gone.<br/><br/>Baron Vladimir Harkonnen has promised Mohiam and the Bene Gesserit that he will not harm Paul or Jessica so he sends some of his men to take them to the desert to die of exposure. Paul, not fully secure in his Bene Gesserit abilities, is still able to use the Voice to order one of the men to remove his mother\\'s gag. Jessica immediately orders one of the men to kill his comrade. When she\\'s fully freed, she kills two of them personally. Their ornithopter is remotely disabled and lands. Paul and Jessica see the devastation of Arrakeen from a distance.<br/><br/>Yueh meets with Baron Harkonnen and demands that the Baron honor his end of the deal. The Baron promises that Yueh will be reunited with his wife and then slits his throat. The Baron then gloats over a paralyzed Leto, who bites down on his fake tooth and expels the poison, killing everyone in the room except for the Baron who is gravely injured, having activated his body shield and used his anti-gravity suspensors to float to the ceiling. Medical technicians nurse the Baron back to health.<br/><br/>Riding out a storm in a survival tent, Paul continues to have visions from his spice exposure. They are first of Chani. However, they quickly change to visions of bloody conflict and religious zealots, operating under the Atreides flag and in Duke Leto\\'s name, spreading across the galaxy \"like and unquenchable fire\". Paul is horrified by what he sees and blames his mother and the Bene Gesserit but is eventually comforted by his mother.<br/><br/>Paul and Jessica are rescued by Duncan Idaho, who managed to escape the slaughter. Duncan brings them to Kynes, who has set up in an abandoned terraforming station occupied by Fremen. The Sardukar track them there and attack, with the Fremen killing many of them. Duncan sacrifices himself in a last stand to allow Paul, Jessica, and Kynes to escape. Paul and Jessica flee in an ornithopter. Kynes sets up a thumper, intending to call a sandworm and ride it away, but she is mortally wounded by the Sardukar. Before they can deliver the killing blow, a sandworm arrives and Kynes attracts it to her by pounding a patch of drumsand. They are all swallowed by the worm.<br/><br/>While piloting the ornithopter through a powerful sand storm, Paul has a vision of a Fremen man giving him advice, telling him that survival in the desert is a process and that he must move with the flow of the environment. Paul retracts the \\'thopter\\'s wings and allows them to be carried deeper into the desert by the vortex of the storm. They survive but with the ornithopter damaged they must set out on foot through the desert. As they do, they are observed by Fremen.<br/><br/>Jessica and Paul make their way toward where they believe the Fremen sietch is. Their movements attract a sandworm and they make a run for some nearby rocks. The sandworm pauses, seemingly looking at Paul for few seconds before a thumper draws it away. A group of Fremen capture them. Stilgar is with them and recognizes Paul, saying that they can\\'t touch him. Another Fremen, Jamis, dismisses Stilgar\\'s belief and wants to kill Paul and Jessica and loot their bodies. Paul recognizes Jamis as the man from his visions.<br/><br/>Jessica asks for help returning to Caladan, saying that they will be well rewarded, but Stilgar dismisses any reward they\\'d give as pointless. Stilgar offers to allow Paul, who is still young, to join their sietch, but says that Jessica, who he deems too old to learn to fight, must be left behind. Jessica and Paul use their Bene Gesserit training to disarm most of the Fremen and hold Stilgar at knife point. Stilgar, realizing that Jessica is a Bene Gesserit, relents and decides to take both of them to the sietch. Jamis objects, and challenges Jessica to a duel.<br/><br/>Paul agrees to stand as his mother\\'s champion. Chani, who is among the party, takes pity on Paul, who she believes will die at Jamis\\' hand, and gives him her crysknife, a dagger made from the tooth of the sandworm, a moment from one of Paul\\'s visions. In the duel, Paul outclasses Jamis, repeatedly holding a knife to his throat and demanding that he yield. Stilgar informs him that Fremen duels are to the death, and Jessica says that Paul has never killed anyone before. Reluctantly, Paul kills Jamis. Satisfied, the Fremen take Paul and Jessica back to their sietch.<br/><br/>Paul and Jessica see a Fremen impossibly riding a live worm. As they begin their journey into the desert, Chani tells Paul that \"this is only the beginning\".</div></div>'}\n",

Kal-El, despite the pleas of the spirit of his long-lost mother, willingly agrees, and now a normal human being, consummates his love for Lois - a decision that dooms the Earth as three criminals from Krypton, freed from their extra-dimensional prison, lay waste to the planet in a path of conquest aided by the planet\\'s most arrogant criminal, Lex Luthor, who intends to smoke out Superman for his destruction - unaware as he is of The Man Of Steel\\'s helplessness, a condition that only one last hope can rectify.<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=Michael%20Daly&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_4\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Michael Daly</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">A group of terrorists seize the Eiffel Tower &amp; threaten Paris with a hydrogen bomb if the French government does not meet their demands.

The Man of Steel, however, is unaware of their arrival, and is forced to sacrifice his powers for a life with Lois Lane. When he finds out about Zod &amp; his companions, Superman returns to the Fortress of Solitude to regain his powers and confront the horrible Kryptonian criminals - on his terms.

The general removes a red spire from the table and destroys it; the thunderclap as the piece is shattered resonates through the city and sets off a trap that ensnares the three brigands. The red spire\\'s destruction is clearly an act of treason, and for this and other crimes they are sentenced by Jor-El and the Krypton council to banishment into the Phantom Zone.<br/><br/>On Earth, in the present day, Clark Kent arrives at the Daily Planet for work. He talks to his editor Perry White, who\\'s working on the latest cover story. Kent asks Perry what\\'s going on and Perry tells him a small group of terrorists are holding hostages at the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris and are threatening to detonate a hydrogen bomb. Perry had sent his ace reporter, Lois Lane, to Paris on a Concorde jet to get the story. Kent leaves the Planet building, ducks into an alley and transforms into Superman, flying off to Paris.<br/><br/>At the Eiffel Tower, Lois is able to sneak past security and stows away on the bottom of the elevator that brings the hostages down from the top. When a French commando team determines the hostages are safe and they believe the terrorists have taken the bomb out of the elevator, they cut the power and destroy the chain drive. The elevator plummets, taking the bomb and Lois with it. Superman arrives and stops the car, helping Lois off. He then flies the car out into space, past the Moon, where it explodes.<br/><br/>The Phantom Zone is nearby and cracked by the shockwave. The three criminals are freed, finding themselves with super powers granted by the yellow light of Earth\\'s sun. After attacking human astronauts on the moon and the small town of East Houston, Idaho, the three travel to the White House and force the President of the United States to surrender to Zod (on behalf of the entire planet) during an international television broadcast. When the President warns Zod that Superman will stop them, Zod announces his demand for Superman to come and \"kneel before Zod!\"<br/><br/>Prior to Zod\\'s arrival, Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent on assignment for the Daily Planet to Niagara Falls. Lois becomes suspicious that Clark is Superman and tries to lure him into revealing his identity by throwing herself into the Niagara River gorge downstream, but Clark manages to save her with subtle use of his powers. That night, Clark accidentally reaches into the room\\'s fireplace to recover his glasses after he trips; when Lois discovers his hand isn\\'t the slightest burnt, Clark is forced to admit he is Superman.<br/><br/>Superman takes her to his Fortress of Solitude near the North Pole and shows her the traces of his past stored in the energy crystals of the Fortress, one of which is the green crystal that created the Fortress and opened Superman\\'s contact with his long-deceased parents. Lois misplaces the green crystal under her purse. Superman, talking to a hologram of his mother, Lara, decides to undergo a transformation to make himself human by exposing himself to the red Kryptonian sunlight to become romantically closer to Lois, despite Lara\\'s warnings. The process destroys many of the energy crystals, except the green crystal, lying a considerable distance away. After spending the night together, the two return to populated areas by conventional means.<br/><br/>In a remote truck stop, Clark becomes the target of a brash, bullying trucker who beats him up. Clark realizes he\\'s just as vulnerable as a human, shocked by the sight of his own blood. Suddenly, he and Lois see a live broadcast of Zod with the US President, demanding that Superman reveal himself and kneel to Zod. Realizing that humanity cannot fight Zod themselves, Clark decides to return to the Fortress to try to reverse the transformation. His hike to the Fortress is nearly impossible and one he arrives, he admits to his father that he made a grave mistake and that his adopted homeworld is in more danger than ever. As he\\'s ready to give up, he notices the green crystal lying nearby.<br/><br/>Lex Luthor, who has managed to escape from jail (with Eve Teschmacher\\'s assistance), has tracked down the Fortress using an alpha wave detector, and infiltrated the Fortress before Superman and Lois arrived, learning from the crystal of Superman\\'s mother of Superman\\'s connection to Jor-El and of General Zod. He traces Zod to Washington, D.C., and offers to lead Zod to Jor-El\\'s son in exchange for control of Australia. Accepting his offer, the three Kryptonians are directed by Luthor to the offices of the Daily Planet where they abduct Lois. Though Zod is initially disappointed, Luthor convinces him that any threat to Lois will bring Superman to her aid.<br/><br/>Superman arrives, after having reversed his transformation process, and attempts to fight the three. The battle wages over much of Metropolis with Superman courageously holding his own until Zod realizes Superman cares for the innocent humans and take advantage of this weakness. To protect Metropolis, Superman flies off in retreat. Zod declares his victory but Luthor scoffs until he reveals that he knows the location of the Fortress of Solitude. Zod, Ursa, and Non fly to the Arctic, taking Luthor and Lois with them.<br/><br/>At the Fortress, Superman attempts to lay one last trap to stop Zod but fails and stops his fight with the three when they threaten to kill Lois. Knowing that the three Kryptonians pose a threat to the entire world, Luthor listens as Superman tells him to try and trick them all into the crystal chamber that will transform them into humans. Zod catches on and forces Superman to enter the chamber himself. Luthor himself initiates the process by placing the green crystal in the remaining control panel. While Superman is in the transformation chamber, the rest of the Fortress is bathed in red light. Zod demands that Superman kneel to him and take his hand. Superman slowly crushes Zod\\'s hand in his and flings him into a pit. Luthor realizes that Superman had reversed the power of the chamber to protect him and transform the criminals. Non, unable to fly, falls into the pit and Lois punches Ursa, who suffers the same fate as her comrades.<br/><br/>Superman returns Luthor to the authorities, despite the criminal\\'s pleas that he was in on his plan. Superman returns Lois to her home. At the Daily Planet the following day, Superman (as Clark) kisses Lois, using his telepathic abilities to wipe Lois\\' mind of all the events surrounding Zod\\'s arrival on Earth including her knowledge that Clark and Superman are the same person. At the truck stop where he was beaten up by the bullying driver, Clark takes revenge on the bullying truck driver who assaulted him.<br/><br/>Superman restores the damage done by Zod, and as he replaces the flag on top of the White House, promises the President to never again abandon his duty.</div></div>'}\n",

The Watchmen - comprised of the Comedian, Dr. Manhattan, Nite Owl II, Ozymandias, Rorschach and Silk Spectre II - are a disparate band of masked superheroes, modeled after the Minutemen, who were masked superheroes of a generation earlier, most of who are dead or afflicted by the ravages of life. The Comedian belongs to both groups. Despite the activities of the Watchmen leading to the west winning the Vietnam War which in turn has kept <a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0633271/?ref_=ttpl\">Richard Nixon</a> in the White House, Nixon has now outlawed masks, resulting in the Watchmen disbanding and going into retirement, most hiding their Watchmen past under their human identities. However, the Comedian, in his human persona of Eddie Blake, and Dr. Manhattan - former physicist Jon Osterman who obtained his superhero powers through a scientific accident which almost killed him - now work for the government. Dr. Manhattan\\'s powers in particular have kept a watch over nuclear proliferation, as he is able to stop any nuclear attack. Regardless, the Cold War is at its height with recent Soviet posturing regarding nuclear bomb buildup. In her human persona of Laurie Jupiter, Silk Spectre II is Dr. Manhattan\\'s assistant and lover, as much as they can be in Dr. Manhattan\\'s now non-human state. Meanwhile, Ozymandias has come out to the world as wealthy genius Adrian Veidt, capitalizing on his Ozymandias identity to better the world, and Rorschach continues to work as a vigilante, although one wanted by the law despite he the reason that many criminals are behind bars. When Blake is murdered, Rorschach, as the only one still on the streets, believes the murderer is out to kill all the Watchmen, despite any number of people wanting to kill the Comedian for being a misogynist. Evidence points to it perhaps having something to do with an imminent attempt of nuclear annihilation. Rorschach has to convince his colleagues, who he has not seen since their superhero days, of the validity of his theory for them to come out of retirement, which is no easy task. If they do, which will require them to overcome external forces which seem to be conspiring against them, they will have to discover both who killed the Comedian and why before they befall the same fate as him and/or before the mastermind is able to exact his larger grand plan.<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=Huggo&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_2\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Huggo</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">In a gritty and alternate 1985 the glory days of costumed vigilantes have been brought to a close by a government crackdown, but after one of the masked veterans is brutally murdered, an investigation into the killer is initiated.

When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the masked vigilante Rorschach, washed up but determined, sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion -- a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers -- Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity... but who is watching the Watchmen?<br/><br/>==========================================<br/><br/>Before the credits, a mid-60\\'s man in a bathrobe, puffing on a cigar, sits alone in his apartment watching PBS\\' The McLaughlin Group discuss a potential nuclear war with Russia. A tall slim figure breaks into the room. The two start to fight. After they trade blows the assailant is clearly getting the upper hand, and he hurls the man in the bathrobe out the window of his high-rise. He is killed when he hits the ground, and a smiley face button soon lands on the pavement next to his body.<br/><br/>The opening credits show historical pictures as Bob Dylan\\'s \"Times They are a Changin\" plays. Masked, costumed vigilantes fight crime in America. In the 1930s and \\'40s, the vigilantes formed a group called the Minutemen to \"finish what the law couldn\\'t.\" The original lineup was heroic and helped catch criminals and win World War II. But they often suffered early and violent deaths in action, or became suicides, or were arrested for breaking the law themselves, or in one case were committed to an asylum.<br/><br/>We see a blue, other-worldly man shaking hands with President Kennedy; later we see a cigar-puffing man who might be the bathrobed man at the start of the movie (a bit younger) holding a rifle on the \"grassy knoll\" after Kennedy has been shot. And, in the glass of the helmet of the astronaut on the moon\\'s surface, we do not see an American flag; we see the blue man again with a camera.<br/><br/>A second generation of heroes has formed, called the Watchmen. We see them being photographed -- as the movie goes on, we will learn that these are the Comedian (a burly guy with a simple mask over his eyes and chomping on a cigar), Laurie Jupiter (the new Silk Spectre), Dr. Jon Osterman (Doctor Manhattan, the naked blue humanoid, with true superpowers), Adrian Veidt (Ozymandias, whose costume is like that of a Greek god), Daniel Dreiberg (the new Nite Owl, looking somewhat like Batman), and Rorschach (in a trench coat and hat with a knitted mask that completely covers his face and displays constantly changing ink blots).<br/><br/>TV news reports that Nixon has been elected to a third term. By the 1980s, public opinion has turned against costumed heroes, who are considered a dangerous alternative to the police.<br/><br/>It is October 12, 1985. Investigating the murder of the man who fell to his death at the start of the movie, who we now know is Eddie Blake, Rorschach enters the crime scene apartment with a sophisticated grappling gun. Searching the apartment, he discovers the uniform, weapons and memorabilia of the Comedian, a former member of both the Minutemen and the Watchmen. We hear the voice over of what Rorschach will write in his journal: \"Tonight, a comedian died in New York. Somebody knows why.\" He has to beat up a couple of policemen to get out of the building.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Daniel Dreiburg is at the home of Hollis Mason, the original Nite Owl. The two have regular meetings and talk about old times. Hollis says that it all started with the gangs. The Minutemen were a masked response to the masked gangs. They discuss the Comedian\\'s death and Rorschach\\'s vigilante activities. Nixon\\'s policies don\\'t allow masked vigilantes, but this hasn\\'t stopped Rorschach.<br/><br/>As Daniel leaves, they see a report about Rorschach and the policemen on television. Daniel leaves in the rain and goes home, where he finds that Rorschach has broken into his home, and is in his kitchen. Rorschach shows Daniel the smiley face button that he found where the Comedian was killed. They go down to the Nite Owl lab, under Daniel\\'s home, where Rorschach speculates that someone is killing the superheroes. Daniel says \"The Watchmen are over\" and that Rorschach could give it up since no one knows who he is.<br/><br/>In his journal, Rorschach speculates that nuclear war is coming.<br/><br/>The rich and brilliant Adrian Veidt is being interviewed. The reporter observes that only Adrian and Hollis ever revealed their true identities. Adrian talks about developing renewable energy sources, and that if he could eliminate fear of not having enough, war would be obsolete. Daniel is watching the interview, and he warns Adrian that someone may be after the Watchmen. Adrian is not worried. Adrian speculates that a being like Dr. Manhattan, with his powers that can control atomic structure, might be able to stop much of a nuclear strike, but not all of it.<br/><br/>The next evening, Rorschach sneaks into the US Army Rockefeller Military Research Center to warn Dr. Manhattan and Laurie Jupiter who live there in private quarters. Manhattan can normally see the future, but he says that he cannot see it now due to temporal interference caused by tachyons moving through time that may have resulted from a nuclear holocaust. He transports (\"zaps\") Rorschach outside the military facility in mid-sentence when he upsets Laurie; Rorschach challenges Laurie\\'s judgement of the Comedian, who once tried to rape her mother. Rorschach refers to the incident as a \"moral lapse\". Manhattan then tells Laurie that he has been working with Adrian to solve the energy crisis in an effort to avert the war. Manhattan reads her mind, and observes her parents fighting (we see this same scene repeated twice more in the movie). He also tells Laurie that he knows she wanted to have dinner with him, but that she will instead be going out to dinner with Daniel.<br/><br/>When Laurie arrives at the restaurant, Daniel is obviously smitten. They have dinner and talk about the old days. She observes that the Keene Act, which outlawed costumed vigilantism, has prevented them from going out as superheroes. Laurie confides that Jon (Dr. Manhattan) is becoming more remote. As she gets in a cab to leave the restaurant, Daniel observes that she is being watched by a \"government escort\". She responds that they don\\'t want her upsetting the country\\'s most valuable asset.<br/><br/>At a cemetery, the Comedian is given a funeral with military honors, while Simon and Garfunkel\\'s \"Sounds of Silence\" plays.<br/><br/>Laurie is teleported to her mother\\'s home by Dr. Manhattan, where she immediately throws up into the toilet. The older woman, Sally Jupiter, observes that she thought Laurie would have gotten used to that means of travel by now. \"It beats flying coach,\" says Sally. She is drinking margaritas in the afternoon and reminiscing about her old Minuteman days, when she was the original Silk Spectre. She shows Laurie a pornographic comic that is based on Sally\\'s super-hero of the 1940s (the original Silk Spectre). Laurie is appalled by her mother\\'s behavior.<br/><br/>In a flashback, Sally remembers the original Minutemen having a group photo taken in a wood-paneled club. Afterward, Sally goes to the billiards room to change out of her costume and the Comedian enters, making suggestive advances toward her. Sally tries to push him away but the Comedian brutally punches her and is ready to rape her when another member of their team, Hooded Justice, intervenes and beats Blake severely. Blake suggests that Justice gets off on beating men and Justice stops. Sally concludes the flashback with a cryptic observation about Eddie Blake.<br/><br/>Back at the rainy cemetery, Dr. Manhattan and Daniel are there. Manhattan remembers that during the Vietnam War, the Comedian and Manhattan fought the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army, turning the tide of the war and allowing the United States to win. In a bar, as the war is over, a Vietnamese woman confronts the Comedian and tells him she is pregnant with his child. When the drunken Comedian refuses to take responsibility and insults her, she slashes his face with a broken bottle, causing a permanent scar. Infuriated, and over Manhattan\\'s pleas for him to stop, the Comedian shoots and kills the woman. Blake then berates Manhattan for not stopping him, claiming that his failure to act shows that Manhattan doesn\\'t really care about humanity.<br/><br/>Adrian also watches the coffin being laid to rest and remembers a meeting of the Watchmen. He recalls that the Comedian was a sarcastic, misanthropic pessimist, while Ozymandias wanted to help humankind. The Comedian burns Adrian\\'s display, saying that the threat of nuclear war trumps any efforts by the \"Crimebusters\" group Adrian wants to form.<br/><br/>Daniel recalls a time when the Comedian and the Night Owl tried to calm a rioting group of protesters during a police strike; the comic gleefully fought with the protesters and shot tear gas at the people. Daniel, obviously bothered by the way lawlessness has engulfed the nation, asks the Comedian \"What happened to the American Dream?\" Amidst the destruction caused by the mob, the Comedian answers \"It came true! You\\'re lookin\\' at it.\" Blake also mentions that Congress was enacting new legislation that would outlaw costumed vigilantes.<br/><br/>A tall, wizened man pays his respects and goes back to his flat by an adult movie theatre. He is \"Moloch\", a one-time \"arch-enemy\". In his home, he is assaulted by Rorschach, who wants to know why Moloch went to the funeral. Moloch says that Eddie Blake had broken into Moloch\\'s house a week before, very drunk, and had cried and rambled about a list.<br/><br/>Laurie and Jon are having an intimate erotic moment when Laurie realizes Jon has replicated himself. At first, she is put off by making love to two people at the same time, but then she realizes that a third Jon is working on the energy design at the same time. Angry at not having his full attention she throws an object through the blue figure\\'s head. Laurie leaves as Jon teleports the machine to Adrian in Karnak, his Antarctic stronghold. Laurie goes to Daniel\\'s house saying she has nowhere else to go. He is going to meet Hollis for their weekly session and invites her to join him.<br/><br/>Jon dresses in a suit and tie (without physically touching his clothes) and zaps himself over to a TV studio for an interview. At the same time, while Dan and Laurie are walking to Hollis\\', they are confronted by a large gang of street thugs. Dressed in their street clothes, they defend themselves with vigor.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, at the interview, Manhattan is accused of afflicting many of his former colleagues with cancer. His once very close girlfriend, Janie Slater, appears and reveals that she too is stricken, and she damns Jon in public. In the ensuing press scrum, Jon screams \"leave me alone\", and he zaps everyone out of the studio.<br/><br/>Laurie and Daniel\\'s fight with the thugs ends, and she decides not to continue on to Hollis\\'. Daniel and Hollis watch the end of Manhattan\\'s interview on television. Hollis remarks that Manhattan was \"crucified\" in front of a national audience.<br/><br/>Dr. Manhattan teleports himself to Mars. There he recalls many events in a haphazard order. Years ago he had a loving relationship with Janie; he reassembled a watch with his father; he was trapped in an atomic chamber by a time lock before a lab accident turned him from a human scientist, Jon Osterman, into Dr. Manhattan; how he fell in love with Laurie.<br/><br/>Manhattan is slowly \"resurrected\" as a nervous system, a skeleton, and finally, a blue humanoid. TV news reports \"The superman exists and he is an American\". Dr. Manhattan is told he needs a logo, and he draws a circle with a dot in the middle on his forehead, a symbol of a hydrogen atom. President Nixon enlists his help to end the Vietnam war, which he does.<br/><br/>The TV reporter now denies that he said the quote about Superman. Instead, he says, that his words are \"God exists and he\\'s an American\". The flashbacks end, and Dr. Manhattan observes that he is tired of humans, and he begins to build a large, watch-like device on Mars.<br/><br/>Laurie is confronted by government officials for \"not doing her job\" (appeasing Dr Manhattan both physically and emotionally) and allowing him to leave Earth. In a flashback, while dressed as the Silk Spectre, she meets the Comedian. Her mother intervenes and tells him to stay away from her daughter.<br/><br/>Nixon, Kissinger and the war cabinet consider the recent events with the Soviet Union and prepare for war. Nixon seems willing to lose the East coast in a nuclear war with the Soviets, and he tells them to begin fueling America\\'s bomber planes. Nixon says Dr. Manhattan has two days to solve the problems, and he \"hopes he\\'s on our side\".<br/><br/>Laurie tells the government officials that the only one who can bring back Jon is himself.<br/><br/>Lee Iaccoca and other industrial leaders have a disagreeable meeting with Adrian. Adrian reminds them of his brilliance, and how he has had a desire to be like Alexander the Great and unify the world. He also says he\\'s wealthy enough to buy them several times over and tells them they can leave. As Iaccoca apologizes, the elevator door opens, and a deliveryman starts shooting. Veidt eludes the bullets, one of which hits Iaccoca between the eyes, and subdues the shooter but the man swallows a poison pill, froths at the mouth, and dies.<br/><br/>Laurie and Daniel discuss the attack as they lunch at the Gunga Diner. Daniel says that it is not safe for the former heroes, and as they leave the diner, he suggests Laurie move in with him, for safety. She agrees, and they leave the diner. We hear Rorschach\\'s voice over, in which he says that he is watching them walk away, but not in his costume.<br/><br/>Rorschach later reviews the ID card of the man who tried to kill Adrian. The man worked for Pyramid International and Rorschach remembers he had seen a letter from Pyramid earlier at Moloch\\'s apartment. He returns to Moloch\\'s apartment, but he discovers that Moloch is so recently dead that his cigarette is still smoldering. The police have the building surrounded and know that Rorschach is inside. Realizing he\\'s been set up for the murder, Rorschach makes a torch out of a spray can and fights his way out of the building. Nonetheless, he is captured and unmasked. He is identified on the TV News as Walter Kovacs, age 35.<br/><br/>Walter is jailed for the murder of Moloch until sentencing. The state psychiatrist, Dr. Malcolm Long, tells Walter that he won\\'t want to be in the general population, because criminals he captured will want to get even. He gives Walter a psych assessment. As Walter looks at ink blots, he recalls moments in his life. At an early age, he sees his mother kissing a man. She slaps him and says that she \"should have had that abortion.\" We also see a young Walter seriously injure much bigger kids who are taunting him. Walter resents being called \"Walter\" by the psychiatrist, and he talks about how evil society is. He recalls a seminal event, when he was a young Rorschach, and he uncovered the grisly murder of a 6-year old girl by a pedophile. Finding a cleaver at the scene of the crime, he brutally cleaves the murderer\\'s head in two with multiple blows. He tells Long that \"Walter died that night\" and only Rorschach remains. Long leaves, saying \"I can\\'t help him.\" In prison, Walter is taunted by another inmate on the food serving line, and Walter splashes him with hot grease from a deep fryer, burning him horribly. Rorschach screams to the rest of the population \"I\\'m not locked up in here with you, YOU\\'RE LOCKED UP IN HERE WITH ME!\"<br/><br/>Laurie snoops around in the basement of Daniel\\'s building, and she finds the Night Owl\\'s lab and his flying machine. She pushes a random button that activates the ship\\'s flamethrower, starting a fire in the lab. Daniel comes down to help her put out the fire. He tells her that the ship is called \"Archie\" after Merlin\\'s pet owl, Archimedes. He says that he inherited a lot of money from his father who was disappointed that he became a crime fighter. Daniel tells Laurie that Hollis was his hero. She tries on the night vision owl goggles, and she says that this must be how Jon sees. Daniel looks disappointed and goes upstairs. Laurie follows and tells him \"Jon sees a lot of things, but he doesn\\'t see me.\" The two make love on the sofa as Daniel observes that they may be going too fast. Laurie says that they have all the time in the world. A newscast in the background reports the buildup of Soviet tanks.<br/><br/>Locked in his cell, Rorschach is taunted by a dwarf, Big Figure, a crime kingpin he had arrested 15 years earlier, now looking for revenge. Big Figure tells Kovacs that he can wait as long as necessary to get into his cell.<br/><br/>Daniel has a strange dream in which he and Laurie are naked on a field under the stars. She pulls off their \"skin\" revealing their superhero costumes as a nuclear explosion goes off and vaporizes them. He awakens, and Laurie finds him staring at his Night Owl gear. The two decide to get into costume, take Archie out and \"do something stupid\". Archie flies around the city as they listen for police messages. They hear of a burning building and go to rescue a group of people trapped on an upper floor. Night Owl drops her into the burning building and then lines up Archie as she sends all of the trapped people into the ship, just a moment before an explosion would have killed them all. After dropping off the passengers, Daniel puts the flyer on autopilot and the two superheroes have steamy sex in the aircraft.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a prison riot is taking place. One of the dwarf\\'s large henchmen attempts to grab Kovacs behind the bars. Rorschach grabs and binds the man\\'s hands to the bars. Another henchman comes with a grinder and proceeds to first cut the others arms off and then cut open Rorschach\\'s cell bars.<br/><br/>We cut to Laurie and Daniel in the aftermath of their lovemaking. They decide to try to rescue Rorschach from prison.<br/><br/>Back at the prison, Rorschach quickly subdues the grinder man against the cell toilet and the dwarf runs for his life.<br/><br/>Back in costume, Silk Spectre and Night Owl land at the prison where a full scale prisoner revolt is in progress. Meanwhile, Rorschach heads straight for the psychiatrist\\'s office and gets his mask. Silk Specter and Night Owl arrive and subdue dozens of prisoners with fists and kicks. We see the dwarf run into the men\\'s bathroom to hide, as Silk Spectre and Night Owl find Rorschach. Before he leaves, he says \"Excuse me, I have to visit the men\\'s room\". For a moment, we see Big Figure through the swinging door, and we see water and blood running on the floor after Rorschach leaves.<br/><br/>Back in Daniel\\'s basement lair, Night Owl and Laurie revel in the fun of their evening. Dr. Manhattan appears and zaps Laurie to Mars with him. As he says how beautiful it is, she doubles over and throws up.<br/><br/>Night Owl and Rorschach go out again and find out that Janie Slater, who worked for Pyramid, hired Adrian Veidt\\'s assassin. They decide to \"follow the money\".<br/><br/>Sally calls Hollis, and Hollis tells her that the news is reporting Night Owl and Silk Spectre\\'s rescue of the people trapped in the burning building. They revel in the joy of their proteges. Immediately afterwards, young thugs, knowing that Hollis was the original Night Owl, break into his apartment. He fights valiantly, but they kill him.<br/><br/>Rorschach and Night Owl argue, but Rorschach offers his hand in friendship, and they agree to go out in costume looking for the person who tried to kill Adrian. They hear on the TV news that Hollis has been murdered, and Night Owl badly beats up a gang member, even though he is not sure who killed Hollis.<br/><br/>On Mars, Manhattan tells Laurie what she is going to tell him, and she observes that \"the most powerful thing in the universe\" is \"just going through the motions.\" She apologizes for sleeping with Dan, and remarkably, Manhattan seems unaware. He explains that \"My red world here means more than your blue one,\" as his machine emerges behind them.<br/><br/>In the War Room, Nixon orders Def Con 1 to send the bombers.<br/><br/>Rorschach and Night Owl break into Adrian\\'s office. Night Owl guesses that the password to Adrian\\'s computer is \"RamesesII\" and they find out that Pyramid is owned by Adrian\\'s company, Veidt International.<br/><br/>In Antarctica, at Karnac, a group of scientists raise a toast to Manhattan\\'s energy reactor, which is now online. Adrian, dressed as Ozymandias, compares the scientists to the Egyptian servants who were buried with their pharaoh, as he steps over their poisoned bodies. A moment later he has them disintegrated in a manner similar to Jon Osterman\\'s accident. Back in NYC, Rorschach records his suspicions in his journal, which he drops through mail slot in the door of the \"New Frontier\" newspaper.<br/><br/>On Mars, Laurie pleads for help for the Earth. Manhattan says that \"The universe will not even notice\" and that \"Life is overrated\". He wonders how things are better with another oil pipeline or shopping mall. She tells him to send her back to Earth to be \"fried\" with her mother and Daniel. She challenges Manhattan to \"do that thing you do\" and confront her with details of her life that she doesn\\'t want to remember. Probing her memories, Manhattan reveals to her that her mother eventually had a romantic relationship with the Comedian, despite his previous attempted rape of her. Blake is revealed to be her biological father, and she is distraught, saying \"My life is just one big joke.\" She smashes Manhattan\\'s watch-like machine; Manhattan generates a protective field around them both, sheltering them from the debris. Manhattan tells her that he was wrong about undervaluing miracles. He notes that against \"unfathomable odds\" Laurie came from the coupling of Sally and the Comedian, \"a miracle\". The view pulls back from Mars, revealing that they are standing in a giant smiley face on the planet\\'s surface.<br/><br/>Rorschach and Nite Owl fly south to Karnac (in Antarctica) where Archie, having been underwater in New York for many hours, freezes from the water still in it &amp; is suddenly rendered unpilotable, crash lands. Jimi Hendrix\\'s \"All Along the Watchtower\" plays as Ozymandias watches Rorschach and Nite Owl hiking in the snow towards Karnac on one of dozens of televisions that are arrayed before him. Other televisions display newscasts and other information from around the globe. Rorschach and Nite Owl sneak in, thinking that he is unaware of their arrival. In fact, he is fully aware.<br/><br/>They confront Ozymandias, attempting to subdue him in hand-to-hand combat, however, he easily defeats them both. Veidt confirms he is the mastermind behind the Comedian\\'s murder, because he was \"cracking badly\" and had uncovered Ozymandias\\' plan. He also spent $2 billion to manipulate Manhattan into not seeing the future and leaving the Earth, arranged the framing of Rorschach, and also staged his own assassination attempt to place himself above suspicion.<br/><br/>He explains that his plan is to unify the United States and Soviet Union and prevent nuclear war by \"killing millions\" in several of the world\\'s largest cities, \"to save billions.\" Veidt intends to use devices with Dr. Manhattan\\'s unique energy signature to destroy the cities. The world will think Dr. Manhattan is behind all the deaths and will unite against him, thereby stopping the impending nuclear war. Rorschach and Nite Owl attempt to stop him, but Ozymandias tells them that he would only tell them his plan if they couldn\\'t possibly prevent it. In fact, he had started the destruction 35 minutes earlier. On TV monitors, they see that the cities are being destroyed. Henry Kissinger tells Nixon that the energy signatures are not nuclear devices launched from the Soviet Union, they are from Dr. Manhattan.<br/><br/>Laurie and Manhattan arrive at the ruins of New York City and see the results of Ozymandias\\'s plan. Manhattan observes that the destruction was \"made to look like I did it.\" They teleport to Karnak to confront Ozymandias. Ozymandias appears to obliterate Manhattan, and Laurie pulls out a gun and shoots him. He falls down the stairs, but then realizes that he caught the bullet and is completely unharmed.<br/><br/>In a first surprise for Ozymandias, Manhattan reappears, telling Veidt that he was able to more easily and quickly reassemble himself, having learned how to do so from the first accident that claimed his life. \"The world\\'s smartest man poses no more threat to me than does its smartest termite.\"<br/><br/>Ozymandias reveals a TV remote control, and all of the televisions are switched to a broadcast of Nixon blaming Manhattan for the destruction. After President Nixon states that the US and Soviets have allied, Dr. Manhattan realizes Ozymandias\\' plan is logical and revealing the conspiracy would only break the peace and lead again to nuclear destruction.<br/><br/>Rorschach is unwilling to remain silent and angrily turns to leave, steadfastly believing that a crime has been committed and that the world must know about it.<br/><br/>Manhattan says that he understands, \"without condoning or condemning\", how Adrian feels about killing millions of innocents to save the planet. Outside Rorschach is confronted by Manhattan. In despair, Rorschach takes off his mask, and he demands that Manhattan kill him; Manhattan finally obliges, leaving only a bloody outline in the snow. Daniel is a witness and cries out in anguish.<br/><br/>Manhattan shares a final kiss with Laurie and departs for another galaxy that is \"a little less complicated. Maybe I\\'ll create some life there\".<br/><br/>After watching Manhattan kill Rorschach, Daniel comes back into the building and attacks Adrian, telling him that he has \"deformed\" mankind. Adrian takes the blows without emotion. Daniel and Laurie fly away in Archie.<br/><br/>We hear the beginning of an episode of The Outer Limits as Laurie talks with her mother. She tells her mother that she knows the Comedian was her father, and they make amends. Daniel appears and says that Archie is all updated and ready.<br/><br/>Daniel observes that \"As long as people think that Jon is still watching, we\\'ll be okay.\"<br/><br/>Outside, life goes on.<br/><br/>A newspaper editor in New York complains of nothing worthwhile to print because of the world-wide peace. He tells a young reporter, Seymour, that it\\'s like living in a world-wide hippie commune where the only hamburgers available have a Russian variation: borscht. The reporter says that they could write a story about Ronald Reagan who may run for president. The editor dismisses this; \"Americans don\\'t want a cowboy in the White House.\" Instead, he tells Seymour he should print whatever he likes from a collection of crank mailings. The camera focuses on the mail basket containing Rorschach\\'s journal.</div></div>'}\n",

Second, Poison Ivy, a villainess with luscious lips full of venom, has arrived in Gotham with her hulking servant, Bane, with plans to team up with Freeze and prepare the way for genetically enhanced plants.

She witnesses Woodrue use the formula to turn a diminutive convict into a hulking monstrosity dubbed \"Bane\". Woodrue and Isley argue over the use of the drug and Woodrue overturns a shelf of various toxins onto her. She transforms into the beautiful and seductive Poison Ivy before killing Woodrue with a kiss from her now-poisonous lips. She finds that Wayne Enterprises funded Woodrue, so she takes Bane with her to Gotham.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, butler Alfred Pennyworth\\'s niece, Barbara Wilson, makes a surprise visit and is invited by Bruce Wayne to stay at Wayne Manor until she goes back to school. Alfred is revealed to be suffering from MacGregor\\'s Syndrome.<br/><br/>Poison Ivy interrupts a Wayne Enterprises press conference to propose a project that could help the environment.

This comes just after their real-world builder Finn (voice of Jadon Sand) is told by his father (voice of Will Ferrell) that his little sister is now allowed to play with Legos. After the Duplos threatens to destroy the Lego people, Emmet approaches them with a heart that he builds as a peace offering, only for the Duplo leader to eat it. Lucy, AKA Wyldstyle (voice of Elizabeth Banks) tries to attack, but this just makes the alien scream powerfully enough to shatter windows. The Duplos start to rampage across Bricksburg, causing structures to collapse. Emmet and Lucy get help from Batman (voice of Will Arnett), Unikitty (voice of Alison Brie), Metalbeard (voice of Nick Offerman), and Benny (Charlie Day), but they are outmatched and defeated. Meanwhile, President Business (also Will Ferrell) ditches them to go golfing.<br/><br/>Five years later, Bricksburg has become Apocalypseburg, with everyone adjusting to their new city by being dark, brooding, and edgy. Lucy says that the Justice League - Superman (voice of Channing Tatum), Wonder Woman (voice of Cobie Smulders), Aquaman (voice of Jason Momoa), Green Lantern (voice of Jonah Hill), and Cyborg - went off to fight the Duplos, but they never returned. Batman stayed behind to do a standalone adventure and is now living in a large fortress with Alfred (voice of Ralph Fiennes). Emmet is the only one who retains his cheerful disposition. He joins Lucy with some coffee, but she is too busy brooding. Emmet then mentions having a crazy dream in which he saw a dolphin clock with a time of 5:15, and a black hole opening that swallows all of his friends in an event called \"Ourmamageddon\". He then shows Lucy that he built them a house just outside of the city, and he brings her over to check it out. While she thinks it\\'s nice, she worries it will attract unwanted attention, and she also thinks Emmet is too childish. Her fears are confirmed when a ship descends toward the city and spots Emmet, Lucy, and Unikitty (who is now huge and goes by Ultrakitty). The pilot fires a heart bomb at the trio, who run away after building an escape buggy. However, they are followed because Emmet puts his blinker on.<br/><br/>They make it to Batman\\'s fortress where they hide from the invader, and Batman attempts to fire at them, but it doesn\\'t work. The invader makes her way in and introduces herself as General Sweet Mayhem (Stephanie Beatriz). She seeks out the leader of the group, and Lucy points Emmet out as \"The Special\". Mayhem disagrees and doesn\\'t see anything special about Emmet. She proceeds to kidnap Lucy, Batman, Unikitty, Benny, and Metalbeard and take them with her. Emmet tries to get the other citizens to help him save his friends, but they don\\'t want to join him due to him being immature. Emmet sets off on his own to rescue his friends by converting his house into a ship.<br/><br/>Mayhem brings the Master Builders to the Systar System where she lives. She takes them to a planet ruled by the shape-shifting Queen Watevra Wa\\'Nabi (voice of Tiffany Haddish). Watevra appears like an evil tyrant, but she does her best to persuade the heroes that she is the complete opposite of a villain by singing a song about it. She manages to persuade the others by appealing to their interests (spaceships for Benny, cute stuff for Unikitty, pirate stuff for Metalbeard, and just appealing to Batman\\'s ego). Everyone but Lucy is convinced that she can be trusted. Watevra wants to marry Batman and unite their worlds, which startles him.<br/><br/>Emmet is making his way through space, only to come across a glassteroid storm. Just before he collides with one, he is saved by the super cool Rex Dangervest (also Chris Pratt), flying in a ship shaped like a fist. He brings Emmet on-board and introduces himself as a galaxy-defending cowboy/raptor trainer (in other words, Chris Pratt\\'s most famous roles). Rex tells Emmet his backstory of how he was left trapped under the dryer in Finn\\'s home and was forgotten by his friends, but he managed to pull himself out and become who he is now. He has a whole control center with raptors that he trained. Rex then decides to join Emmet in his quest to save his friends.<br/><br/>The Master Builders are brought to Planet Sparkles in preparations for the wedding. Lucy is given a wash, revealing that the black in her hair is painted, and her real hair is blue. Watevra\\'s assistants - Ice Cream Cone (voice of Richard Ayoade), Banarnar (voice of Ben Schwartz), and Balthazar (voice of Noel Fielding) - try to get Lucy as pumped up as they are by forcing her to listen to the upbeat \"Catchy Song\". She escapes and finds herself crawling through a vent next to Bruce Willis (voicing himself as a Lego).<br/><br/>At the same time, Emmet and Rex appear on the same planet with other Lego Mini-Figures people. Emmet finds everybody to be overly happy and friendly. The Justice League are there, and Superman is now best buds with Green Lantern (whom he couldn\\'t stand before) and even Lex Luthor (voice of Ike Barinholtz). They also go along and sing \"Catchy Song\", which Rex finds painful.<br/><br/>Batman and Watevra have a private dinner together. Mayhem scans Batman and detects that he is hiding his insecurities under his ego, which Watevra implies is not unlike her. He admits that he is not looking to get hitched, but Watevra responds that she only said she wanted to marry him to make her real crush jealous. This starts to make Batman walk back on his words, just as Watevra starts to sing a song about why she\\'s not into Gotham City guys. Batman relents and makes an official proposal to her.<br/><br/>Numerous citizens gather on top of a giant wedding cake for Batman and Watevra\\'s wedding. Lucy meets up with Emmet and Rex as they both plan to stop the ceremony by smashing the wedding cake. Rex is suspicious of Lucy and thinks she is brainwashed, but Emmet trusts her. As they proceed with their plan, Lucy runs into Mayhem, and in the confrontation, Mayhem is knocked off a ledge. Her helmet falls off, and her deepened tough voice is gone, and she appears genuinely frightened as she holds on for dear life. She slips but Lucy manages to catch her. Mayhem explains that she and Watevra really aren\\'t bad, and that they just wanted to unite their worlds. This leads Lucy to realize that Rex is the true villain, as he is trying to keep everyone apart. Outside, Lucy watches the ceremony and sees Watevra take her true form - the heart that Emmet built all those years earlier for the Duplos. Before Lucy can stop Emmet, he harnesses his \"grown-up\" power and smashes the cake, which causes everything to fall into ruin and tear open a hole.<br/><br/>Everything that happens is a result of the real world where Finn\\'s sister Bianca (voice of Brooklynn Prince) has brought Finn\\'s Legos into her room so that they can play together, but Finn is a jerk and he breaks Bianca\\'s creations. Their mother (voice of Maya Rudolph) comes in and scolds them for fighting, and because the Legos hurt her bare feet, she orders the kids to put the pieces away in a storage bin (the black hole). This makes Emmet\\'s nightmare of Ourmamageddon come true, as the kids pick up all the Legos and leave them trapped in the darkness of the storage bin.<br/><br/>After Emmet realizes what has happened, Rex tells him the truth - he is Emmet from the future! On his trip to save his friends, Emmet ended up under the dryer and was left alone, just watching Finn play without him. He became bitter and forced himself out of the dryer where he made a new tougher, mature image for himself and shunned all the cute and childish things he once valued. He made himself a time machine using bits from the DeLorean, Bill and Ted\\'s phone booth, the Tardis, an H.G. Wells contraption, and a hot tub, and he used it to go back in time to find Emmet before he got lost. Since Emmet doesn\\'t agree with his plans, Rex tosses him out of the ship and back under the dryer.<br/><br/>Lucy, Mayhem, and the Master Builders all feel sad and sing about how everything is NOT awesome, but this doesn\\'t mean that it has to be the end for them. In the real world, Finn realizes that he was rotten to Bianca and remembers how much fun they had playing together when they were younger, and he makes amends with her by bringing her the Watevra heart. Meanwhile, Emmet is stuck under the dryer and attempts to free himself, but he has limited movement down there. Rex joins him to fight and keep him there, but now that Finn and Bianca are playing, Lucy is free and she goes to help Emmet, and they use one of Mayhem\\'s heart bombs to defeat Rex. Rex realizes how wrong he was, but now that Lucy has come to save Emmet, it means that Rex won\\'t exist. He starts to disappear but bids farewell to Emmet and Lucy. The two are then reunited with their friends.<br/><br/>Finn and Bianca combine their worlds so that all the residents now live in harmony. President Business returns from his golf trip but gets kicked out of town almost immediately.

A creature is observing Thomas Whitmore\\'s (Bill Pullman) rousing speech during the battle that took place 20 years earlier (from the first Independence Day film). The creature growls, but it\\'s just a nightmare that Whitmore wakes up from in a jolt.<br/><br/>Whitmore\\'s daughter, Patricia (Maika Monroe), works for current president Elizabeth Lanford (Sela Ward). Patty was a pilot for the military, but she resigned to take care of her father, as he is more frail and disturbed after the invasion. She\\'s friends with Dylan Dubrow-Hiller (Jessie T. Usher), son of Steven Hiller, who died in the years since the battle. Dylan is captain of the military pilots. After the battle, the so-called Earth Space Defense was established, with Area 51 becoming its headquarters.<br/><br/>Patty\\'s fiance, Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth), is on a base on the moon working on a machine with his best friend Charlie (Travis Toth). The machine loosens and nearly collapses onto the base, but Jake uses his pod to lift it and secure it in place. He later gets chewed out by his superior General Jiang Lao (Chin Han).<br/><br/>General Joshua Adams (William Fichtner) is brought to the prison of some captive aliens that were kept alive since the first battle. It\\'s mentioned that for the past 20 years they have been catatonic, but suddenly, a couple of hours ago, they all became animated and agitated.<br/><br/>In Africa, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) arrives with Floyd Rosenberg (Nicolas Wright) at a base to meet warlord Dikimbe Umbutu (Deobia Oparei). David runs into an old flame, Dr. Catherine Marceaux (Charlotte Gainsbourg). They are at the site of a crashed alien ship, one that has a new shape and configuration they\\'ve never seen. Levinson and Marceaux determine that the ship was drilling into the Earth at that point, however they\\'re unable to determine exactly why. Umbutu tells them how he and his men fought the aliens and seized their weapons. Umbutu claims to have seen visions involving the aliens. The ship they\\'ve found has also sent a distress call to its home planet.<br/><br/>The pilots on the moon get a visit from Jiang\\'s niece Rain (Angelababy), whom Charlie becomes smitten with. Dylan also shows up, causing friction since Jake almost accidentally killed him during training. Dylan returns the favor by punching Jake in the face. They are both harshly admonished by Jiang.<br/><br/>The moon base notices a spherical craft approaching them. It is also seen on Earth by those in Africa and those on Lanford\\'s staff. Considering it a threat, Lanford orders the craft to be shot down. The moon team fires its laser cannon at it, sending it hurtling backwards. All teams celebrate, thinking they have scored another victory against aliens.<br/><br/>In Africa, Jake arrives in his shuttle to pick up David, Catherine, Umbutu, and Floyd to the crash site of the craft on the moon, where they find a large container and recover it.<br/><br/>We cut to David\\'s elderly father Julius (Judd Hirsch) at a retirement home where he advertises a book in which he claims he was responsible for saving the planet.<br/><br/>In a hospital, Dr. Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner) has finally awoken from his coma after 20 years. He immediately gets out of bed and scribbles alien symbols on the walls of his room.<br/><br/>On Earth in Washington DC, a celebration is held for shooting down the craft and for the 20th anniversary of the victory over the invaders. Several veterans from the first alien invasion attend, including an elderly and frail General Gray (Robert Loggia). Lanford credits the moon team for their effort. Thomas walks up to speak unexpectedly, but as he is introduced, he tries to warn everyone that \"they\\'re coming back\". At the same time, he, Umbutu, and Brakish all experience the same sensation, just as high above Earth, an enormous ship, many times larger than the first mothership, approaches Earth. It first strikes the moon base, killing Jiang and several others, which Rain witnesses. The ship moves over the North Atlantic Ocean and levitates part of China and Dubai, causing destruction wherever it hovers. London, Shanghai and Dubai are all destroyed when skyscrapers, cars and people are levitated in the air and crash back to the ground. In the chaos, Dylan sees his mother Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) working in a hospital as she leads a woman and her newborn baby to the roof of the hospital. The woman and her baby are rescued, but Jasmine perishes when the building collapses under her, which Dylan sadly watches. Meanwhile, Julius is riding his boat as the attack hits and a large wave strikes his boat, but he survives.<br/><br/>Jake later finds Dylan and offers his condolences. He says he knows his pain since his parents were killed in the first alien attack when he was a child, deeply regretting the last thing he told them was that he hated them.<br/><br/>Thomas goes to the holding cell of a captive alien. He enters to communicate with it, but it grabs him with its tentacle in front of Patty and other soldiers. The alien uses Thomas to say \"she\" is coming. Patty shows a picture of a sphere, which the alien reacts to with anger. The soldiers shoot at the alien, breaking its cell open in the process. Umbutu kills the alien as it crawls out of its exoskeleton bio-mechanical suit.<br/><br/>The military picks up an infrared reading from the new mothership, where they spot the Alien Queen in a chamber at the top of the craft. They figure if they can kill the Queen, they can stop her fleet. Lanford authorizes the retaliatory strike. The newly refitted Earth air force attacks and are met with heavy resistance, both from the mothership and from a new design of alien attacker ships. The pilots fly into the ship and begin unloading on any alien that crosses their path.<br/><br/>The new mothership uses a large beam to bore into the planet\\'s core in the Northern Atlantic. A boat full of men searching for gold near the site are contacted and they are offered money to send back information and to help in stopping the drilling. They jokingly tell the government that they want $100 million and are given the amount without hesitation. They immediately start their monitoring.<br/><br/>The alien warriors also attack Lanford\\'s command bunker in the mountains of Colorado, killing her and most of her Cabinet. At Area 51, Adams is quickly sworn in as her successor.<br/><br/>On Earth, Julius is found by four kids driving away from Florida after being separated from their parents. Julius comforts the oldest girl Sam (Joey King), as she has to take care of her siblings and she has no idea what happened to their parents. Julius takes over the car until they come across a school bus full of kids whose driver abandoned them. Julius brings the four kids onto the bus and drives with all the other kids.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Brakish breaks the container open and uncovers a large white sphere not unlike the one that was shot down. Unsure of how to open it, Floyd activates it by touching it, and the sphere comes to life. It speaks English and explains how the race that it belongs to was extinguished by the alien harvesters. Their planet\\'s core was absorbed by the aliens to refuel their ships, something they have done to countless other planets. The sphere also states how it attempted to evacuate Earth, but it couldn\\'t since the moon team shot down the ship needed for the evacuation.<br/><br/>As the pilots head toward the Queen, they start to realize it\\'s a trap, and that she knows they\\'re coming. The aliens disable the pilots\\' jets and weapons systems with an EMP (electro-magnetic pulse)-like blast. Jake, Dylan, Charlie, and Rain all manage to escape before they are killed. The queen\\'s chamber aboard the large ship separates and flies off, looking for the alien sphere.<br/><br/>A plan is formed to lure the Queen out to an isolated area where they can kill it with a nuclear weapon. Patty volunteers to head the attack, but Thomas makes it out before she can, knowing it\\'s going to kill him. The pilots all get ready to fight as David prepares himself at the site of the attack. Thomas flies into the ship as the Queen\\'s shields go down. Once she is in the trap, Thomas detonates the bombs, destroying the ship at the cost of his life.<br/><br/>Everyone celebrates prematurely as they think the Queen is dead. She\\'s actually very much alive. The enraged Queen (which stands around 100 ft. high) rampages through the deserted area, attacking the pilots trying to strike her down. The drill is also closer to the core by the minute. As this happens, Julius drives the bus toward David\\'s location. The Queen moves to attack the bus. Patty flies her jet above the Queen and fires at her shields. She manages to bring them down as the Queen\\'s fleet starts swarming around her for protection. Jake, Dylan, Charlie, and Rain fly around in the swarm, trying to gain enough speed to break away for a new assault. They break free and shoot at the Queen from behind. She is mortally wounded and bursts out of her exoskeleton and flails around until she collapses and finally dies. The other aliens are brought down, and the drilling ceases. Earth is saved once again.<br/><br/>The mothership ascends and leaves Earth. Jake and Patty are reunited, and they kiss. Charlie tries to get that going on with Rain, but she says \"Dinner first\", to his delight. Brakish then approaches the pilots and his son with the sphere, stating that it can offer them new technology and weapons should they take the fight against the aliens into space before they come back. Everyone agrees, and Brakish closes the film by saying that it\\'s time to \"kick alien ass\".</div></div>'}\n",

With him are supply containers marked WCKD. When the elevator reaches the top, a door above him opens and he\\'s surrounded by a Lord of the Flies type gaggle of young men/boys. Thomas takes off running, but stops when he realizes he\\'s in a small glade surrounded by huge walls.<br/><br/>Gally (Will Poulter) subdues Thomas and keeps him from trying to run into a maze which is accessible through a door in the wall.<br/><br/>The leader of the group, Alby (Ami Ameen), and his consigliere Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) explain the situation to Thomas. Once a month the elevator (or the box as they call it), comes to the surface with supplies as well as a new boy. They all live in the glade and call themselves Gladers. None of them can remember anything about their pasts or why they were sent there, but after a few days their names come back to them. Each boy is given a different job. Some are builders, some are runners. A door opens in the giant wall every day and closes every night. The door leads to a maze that surrounds the glade. Runners go through looking for a way out. \"If you\\'re trapped in the maze over night, the Grievers get you and you die\". The maze changes every night. Alby was the first boy to arrive in the Glade. No one knows why they\\'re there.<br/><br/>Thomas starts to form a friendship with the kid who came up the month before him. He\\'s one of the youngest of the group. His name is Chuck (Blake Cooper).<br/><br/>That night there\\'s a celebration for Thomas. Gally is wrestling one of the other boys and asks if Thomas wants to have a go. They end up sparring and when Thomas hits his head on the ground, he remembers his name.<br/><br/>That night Thomas has a dream. It\\'s full of fleeting images, but a woman (Patricia Clarkson) says, \"Wicked is good.\"<br/><br/>Alby takes Thomas around to show him more of the sites. The boys carve their names on the wall when they arrive. When one dies, they cross off the name. Thomas tries to fit in and he\\'s given the task to go dig up fertilizer from out in the woods. While he\\'s there, he\\'s attacked by Ben (Chris Sheffield) one of the Runners who was stung by a Griever. While they fight, the other boy says, \"This is all your fault. I saw you. That boy has what they call The Changing. A sting will apparently cause tremendous pain and make you prone to violence. There\\'s no cure for it, so they force the boy into the maze at night just as the doors are closing.\" Everyone is concerned that there was a Griever attack during the day.<br/><br/>That night Thomas has another dream. It\\'s more of the lady assuring him that Wicked is good, but now he also remembers himself and a girl about the same age sitting across from each other at work stations going over diagnostics.<br/><br/>The next day, Alby goes into the maze to retrace Ben\\'s path to find out what happened. It rains during the day. Now it\\'s getting late and Alby still hasn\\'t returned. All the boys gather around the entrance to the maze. Just as the doors are about to close, the lead Runner named Minho (Ki Hong Lee) appears with a very injured Alby. Thomas rushes into the maze to help them, but the door closes behind him.<br/><br/>Minho and Thomas use vines to suspend Alby\\'s body and try to keep it safe from the Grievers. Alby was stung while inside the maze. One of the Grievers appears and chases after Thomas. The Grievers looks like gigantic bedbugs with robot legs and scorpion tails. Thomas and the Griever run around a bit as the walls in the maze change. Finally Thomas is able to lure the Griever between two walls that are colliding and SQUISH! Dead Griever.<br/><br/>The next day Gally calls for a meeting of the Gladers. Most are excited that Thomas killed a Griever. There\\'s another group though, lead by Gally who feel that the rules they have were put in place to keep everyone safe and ever since Thomas arrived things have changed like Grievers attacking during the day. Speaking of things changing, the elevator arrives.<br/><br/>The boys run out to check what the elevator brought. Inside are no supplies, only a young girl (Kaya Scodelario). She looks up and says, \"Thomas...\", before passing out. In her hand is a note that reads: \\'She\\'s the last one ever.\\'<br/><br/>Gally calls for Thomas to be punished because non Runners are allowed in the maze. He doesn\\'t like the fact that the girl knew who Thomas was. He\\'s scared that the elevator hasn\\'t gone back down since they took out the girl. Newt says Thomas can be locked up overnight without any food and starting tomorrow, he\\'s a Runner. Gally is mad at his leniency.<br/><br/>Some of the boys go back into the maze to look at the carcass of the Griever, which further upsets Gally. Inside it they find a weird device that has an electronic display reading the number 7. The device also is marked WCKD. The boys realize whoever sends them supplies also made the Grievers.<br/><br/>Minho shows Thomas a map of the maze. There are different outer sections that open each day as the maze changes. Each outer section is numbered. Last night, section 7 was open.<br/><br/>The girl is awake. She\\'s at the top of a tower throwing stuff at the boys on the ground. Thomas yells up to her that it\\'s him. She agrees to let him come up. He explains that her memory was wiped, but in a few days she\\'ll remember her name. She says she already remembers her name. It\\'s Teresa. She remembers Thomas too. He tells her that he\\'s had dreams about her and a lady saying that \"Wicked is good.\" When Teresa woke up she found two syringes in her pocket too.<br/><br/>That night, Thomas deals with his punishment of being locked up. Chuck visits him and brings him some food. He also asks Thomas to give his parents a little carved statue Chuck made. Even though he doesn\\'t remember his parents, he\\'s sure his parents remember him and miss him. Thomas gives back the statue and tells Chuck that he\\'ll be able to give that to his parents himself.<br/><br/>The next morning Thomas and Minho go into the maze along with the device they got from the Griever. The device ends up making clicking noises and guides them to a new section Minho has never seen before. Minho is also concerned that all of the outer sections of the maze seem to be open. They get to a wide area marked WCKD Loading Dock that ends up in a dead end, but the device turns from red to green and opens a new path. That path leads to what looks like some sort of sewer tunnel. The edges of the tunnel have the same slime that the Grievers secrete, so they go back to the Glade.<br/><br/>Thomas decides to use one of the syringes on the still changing Alby. It ends up making him better. When he comes to he tells Thomas, \"You were their favorite.\" But we don\\'t find out what he means because outside doors all over the maze begin to open and out pour scores of Grievers.<br/><br/>The Griever attack that wipes out lots of the boys and destroys most of their village. Alby is among the dead. Chuck is saved after being grabbed by one of the Grievers. They end up hacking off its tail. After the attack, Thomas realizes that the venom from the Griever stings helps the victim remember, so he takes the hacked off tail and stings himself and he remembers a little bit more.<br/><br/>Thomas remembers that the maze isn\\'t a prison, it\\'s a test. He sees all of the other boys in incubation tubes. A lot of them are in a panic. He also sees himself as a scientist along with Teresa.<br/><br/>The Gladers use the second syringe and Thomas is cured and confesses to everyone that he\\'s one of the people responsible for everyone being there. Gally is furious; he and his group tie Thomas and Teresa to stakes outside the entrance to the maze as an offering. But half the group is still with Thomas so they free them. Now the Gladers are divided.<br/><br/>Thomas tells Gally that he\\'d rather die trying to escape than die in the Glade not trying. Thomas takes a group into the maze. They get to the Loading Dock area from before and are attacked by Grievers again. They go through the sewer tunnel and it leads to a locked door. They need a numerical code to get through. They realize the code must be the sequence in which the maze would normally open. Theresa types it in and everyone goes through a door. Walls crush all the Grievers behind them.<br/><br/>The kids walk through some hallways until they find a door marked exit. (It\\'s seriously a regular old exit door like you\\'d find in any office building). They go through and now they\\'re inside the lab from Thomas dreams and memories. All the scientists are dead. A video starts to play.<br/><br/>The woman from earlier identifies herself as Ava Paige and tells the kids that they don\\'t remember this but there was global devastation by something called the Flare. She was part of a controversial group called The World Catastrophe Killzone Department (WCKD), that believed that in testing the kids they could monitor their brains and find a cure. While she speaks, behind her guerrilla soldiers rush in and start killing other scientists. She tells them she\\'s glad they passed the first test and reminds them that Wicked is good. Before signing off, Paige shoots herself in the head.<br/><br/>A door opens leading outside. Before anyone can leave, Gally shows up. He has a gun. He says that they all belong in the Glade. He goes to shoot Thomas, but Chuck jumps in front of the bullet. Gally gets stabbed in the chest with a knife. Chuck hands the, now bloody, statue to Thomas and dies.<br/><br/>A group, who looks like the guerrilla soldiers from the video, rush in and takes the kids outside to waiting helicopters. At first it looks like they\\'re in the desert, but we pull out to reveal that they\\'re outside what used to be a city. Buildings are destroyed and everything is covered in sand. They fly over the maze and the Glade and no one asks why the helicopters just didn\\'t land inside the Glade and rescue the kids there instead.<br/><br/>In the final shot, it is shown that Paige is alive and wiping fake blood off her head. She says that the kids have taken the bait. More kids survived than she anticipated. The Maze was a success, and now \"phase 2\" can begin as the helicopter flies away to the city of ruins.<br/><br/>To be continued...</div></div>'}\n",

To that end, former Jaeger pilot Raleigh Becket is reactivated as part of a desperate plan to destroy the portal. As Raleigh strives to heal his inner scars and help his new partner conquer hers, an intrepid scientist discovers a way to link to the Kaiju\\'s mind to learn about them.

Deep beneath the Pacific Ocean, a fissure opens up that leads to another dimension. Through the fissure a giant monster appears, and destroys portions of San Francisco. After several days and countless lives lost, the creature is defeated by human military forces.<br/><br/>However, what seemed to be an isolated attack builds as more creatures begin to come through the fissure, attacking coastal cities around the Pacific. The world unites to stop the invaders, and develop the Jaeger Program: a series of giant mechanical \\'monsters,\\' intended to stop the creatures. Original tests to have one pilot per Jaeger prove unsuccessful, as the test subjects were not able to handle the stress and strain of controlling such a huge robot by themselves. It was then decided that each Jaeger would be piloted by two pilots, their memories linked together in the \"Drift\", synchronizing their movements to maneuver the massive machines.<br/><br/>As the Jaegers go to work, they begin to turn the tide, and take down the creatures which are named \"Kaiju\". Pretty soon, the world is enthralled by the Jaegers and their pilots. They become celebrities, and even have merchandise made. As well, the dead Kaiju are soon seen as a black-market commodity, their parts sold off for various collections and medicinal purposes, though many of their bodily fluids are toxic and cause severe environmental pollution. But just as the war seems to be turning in humanity\\'s favor, the Kaiju\\'s attacks become more frequent and more brutal.<br/><br/>In 2020, seven years after the fissure opened, one of the more famous Jaeger duos, Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam), and his older brother, Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) have become heroes with an impeccable record of defeating Kaijus. Pilots of the Jaeger named \"Gipsy Danger,\" they are sent off to stop a category 3 Kaiju heading towards Anchorage. The beast is larger and more powerful than previous category 3s and will be a challenge for the team. Though the information on their monitors shows a fishing boat in the path of the attack, the Becketts are told their priority is to protect Anchorage.<br/><br/>Disobeying orders, the two still save the fishing boat, but end up being brutally attacked by the Kaiju, which possesses a head designed specifically to penetrate the Danger\\'s chest. In the battle, the kaiju rips off the Gipsy Danger\\'s left arm, and tears away a chunk of the vehicle\\'s helmet, sending Yancy to his death. Raleigh barely manages to pilot Gipsy Danger on his own and finishes the battle, using the robot\\'s giant plasma blaster to kill the creature. Raleigh later pilots the Jaeger to a remote beach where it finally collapses. Raleigh walks out, bearing injuries from the battle -- because of the Drift, Jaeger pilots experience the same injuries that their mechanical counterparts do -- and collapses on the beach too, exhausted and emotionally devastated from his brother\\'s death.<br/><br/>After the attack, Raleigh leaves the Jaeger Program, and goes to find work wherever he can. Five years later, he finds work along the Western coast of the United States as a construction worker, helping build a giant coastal wall that is meant to keep the Kaiju out out.<br/><br/>In the 5 years since Raleigh was with the Jaeger program, numerous countries have called for the program to be terminated due to spiraling casualties of Jaeger pilots in the increased Kaiju attacks and the enormous cost of keeping it funded. Many assume that building the coastal barriers will make them safe, but the head of the program, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), claims that the world\\'s leaders are making a terrible mistake. Even though Pentecost claims the program is still viable, it is relocated to Hong Kong and given 8 months of funding before the program will be permanently retired.<br/><br/>Working on the wall near Sitka, Alaska, Raleigh sees television reports that a Kaiju has broken through the wall surrounding Sydney Harbor in Australia. Fortunately, a Jaeger named Striker Eureka was still stationed in the area before being moved to Hong Kong and is able to take the monster down. After seeing the news report, Raleigh is surprised when a helicopter lands near his construction area, with Pentecost requesting he come along. Raleigh is reluctant to join the Jaeger program again, however, Pentecost convinces him that he belongs in the pilot\\'s seat.<br/><br/>Raleigh is then flown to the Hong Kong Base (known as \\'The Shatterdome\\'), where he meets Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi). Mako tells Raleigh that she has studied his moves during his years in action as a Jaeger pilot, Raleigh notes she seems apprehensive.<br/><br/>Pentecost also introduces Raleigh to two scientists under their command. One of them, Dr Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day), is an obsessive \\'Kaiju Fanboy,\\' who studies the creatures from a biological standpoint, through salvaged organs and other parts. The other is Dr Gottlieb (Burn Gorman), who is a more \\'practical\\' man, using his mathematical knowledge to try and pinpoint the frequency of creatures coming through the ocean rift.<br/><br/>Within the Shatterdome, the last remaining Jaegers and their crews have been assembled: The 3-pilot Crimson Typhoon (from China), Cherno Alpha (from Russia), Striker Eureka (fresh from its stint in Australia), and (to Raleigh\\'s surprise) Gipsy Danger. However, since her encounter 5 years ago, she has been rebuilt and retrofitted for more extreme combat.<br/><br/>Raleigh questions Pentecost on just what their plan is. Pentecost explains that are formulating a plan to drop a nuclear weapon into the channel between dimensions. If it works, the channel will be destroyed, stopping any further Kaiju from coming through. Though the plan of attacking the channel has failed in the past, the program\\'s leaders are confident they will be successful this time if all the remaining Jaegers attack simultaneously.<br/><br/>Pentecost soon after meets again with Geiszler and Gottlieb. Gottlieb predicts that mathematically, the number of Kaiju coming up through the rift is increasing. Geiszler meanwhile, wonders if they can learn more about the Kaiju, if they are able to \\'drift\\' with its brain. Having a portion of one, he is eager to test his theory, but is denied by Pentecost, who decides to follow Gottlieb\\'s research.<br/><br/>Without his brother, Raleigh is tasked with helping to find a replacement. However, during a training and reflex exercise, Raleigh becomes irritated when Mako keeps calling him out regarding the number of moves to take down his opponent. Inquiring why she is being so vocal, she responds that he could have taken down his opponents with a shorter amount of moves. After winning approval from Pentecost, Raleigh spars with her and is amazed at her prowess. He proclaims that she should help him co-pilot Gipsy Danger, but Pentecost refuses.<br/><br/>Eventually, another pilot is chosen for Raleigh, but at the last minute, Mako is given permission. A test-run of Gipsy Danger within the Shatterdome appears to be going well, until during the Drift session, Mako gets locked into a tragic memory and almost sets off the Jaeger\\'s plasma cannon within the dome.<br/><br/>Following the incident, Raleigh understands more about Mako and Pentecost. When Mako was a child, she lost her family to a Kaiju attack in Tokyo. Just when it seemed the creature was going to kill her, a Jaeger was deployed that stopped it. The pilot of the Jaeger was Pentecost himself. Even with her becoming unfocused in the drift, Raleigh still wants Mako as his partner, but is again rebuffed by Pentecost.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Dr Geiszler has hooked up a crude connection machine, and hooks into the Kaiju brain in his lab. The strain of the drift is quite overwhelming for Geiszler and Gottlieb shuts it down. Geiszler reports to Pentecost and his men that the link allowed him a glimpse into the other side of the portal. Geiszler had theorized that based on some Kaiju samples, that what they were seeing coming through were cloned creatures, and his drift vision appears to corroborate the theory. Unfortunately, the Kaiju brain has been damaged, and Geiszler needs a fresher brain in order to learn more. Pentecost gives him a small card, and sends him to Hong Kong to look for a man named Hannibal Chau.<br/><br/>Geiszler finds Chau, who is actually an American going under an alias. Chau is a dealer in Kaiju remains, collecting them from battle sites and dealing them on the black market. Geiszler is sufficiently impressed with Chau\\'s secret room containing live specimens that could be useful in his research. Geiszler tells Chau that he wants an intact brain. Chau balks at the idea since recovering a Kaiju brain is nearly impossible -- the skull bone of a Kaiju is too thick to penetrate quickly and the brains become useless when contaminated with ammonia. Geiszler still bats around Chau\\'s arrogance and questioning demeanor, saying that he can use a Kaiju\\'s secondary brain instead. He mentions how he drifted with a Kaiju brain, leading Chau to question that if he connected to the other side, what\\'s to say those on the other side don\\'t know what he now knows? Chau reveals that he\\'d also drifted with a Kaiju brain and the result was permanent injury to his left eye and the danger that the aliens can send any Kaiju to find him in the city.<br/><br/>Shortly after their discussion, two Category 4 Kaijus surface near Hong Kong. Pentecost sends out Crimson Typhoon and the Cherno Alpha to fight the creatures, with Striker Eureka as backup to protect the City\\'s coastline.<br/><br/>Just as discussion had seemed to point to the Kaiju becoming more dangerous, the two that have emerged come with extra accoutrements. One possesses a pouch in its throat containing acid that melts away Cherno Alpha\\'s armor, severely disabling it. Crimson Typhoon\\'s crew take her into the fight, but she is soon overwhelmed by one of the Kaiju that uses a clawed tail to rip off the jaeger\\'s head. Cherno is attacked by the larger of the two Kaiju and defeated when they\\'re forced underwater and the monster crushes their reactor, drowning both pilots.<br/><br/>The father/son team piloting Striker Eureka abandon their orders to protect Hong Kong, and go at the creatures. However, the other Kaiju lets loose an EMP burst that disables Striker Eureka, and the equipment in the Shatterdome. With 2 hours until the system can be rebooted, Striker Eureka is dead in the water until Raleigh offers a solution: though the newer models of Jaeger are digital, the Gypsy Danger is analog and thus more resistant to EMP attacks.<br/><br/>Pentecost sends out Raleigh and Mako, who end up destroying the EMP-armed Kaiju after a protracted battle, but the other one ends up heading into Hong Kong.<br/><br/>While Chau and his associates have fled to their bunker, Dr Geiszler has been thrown out into the streets by Chau to hide in a public fallout shelter. However, when it sounds like the creature has settled directly over them, he begins to panic that Chau may have been right, and that it may be looking for him. As if to answer that the ceiling caves in, and the Kaiju attempts to reach him.<br/><br/>Just then Gipsy Danger appears and distracts the Kaiju. The battle goes through many buildings, and Gipsy is able to freeze and shatter the creature\\'s tail and tear out it\\'s acid sac. However, the battle takes a turn when the creature suddenly sprouts giant wings and begins to carry the Jaeger into Earth\\'s upper atmosphere. Utilizing a new weapon, a large chain-sword, they manage to destroy it before plummeting back to Earth, barely regaining control of the Jaeger as a team to make a safe landing.<br/><br/>Raleigh and Mako return to the Shatterdome to cheers as the pilots of the Eureka also voice their thanks and appreciation. During the jubilation, Raleigh notes Pentecost bleeding slightly from both nostrils. In private, Pentecost explains how, in the earlier days of the Jaeger program, shielding from nuclear contaminants had not been considered and that his condition has been worsening over time.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Geiszler has returned to Chau and demands claim over the dead Kaiju\\'s secondary brain. Chau\\'s men attempt to get to it, but find it damaged and useless. However, they also discover the Kaiju is actually pregnant before their communication link with Chau goes dead. Just then, an infant Kaiju breaks through a slit in the side of its Mother, and attempts to escape before falling down, seemingly choking on it\\'s own umbilical cord. As Chau gloats over the dead infant Kaiju, claiming he\\'d known it couldn\\'t survive very long outside it\\'s mother, the creature rears up and swallows him whole, finally dying in the street.<br/><br/>Dr Gottlieb soon shows up in Hong Kong with Geiszler\\'s machine, and though the first attempt almost killed him, Gottlieb volunteers to drift with the other scientist, to cooperate in learning more through the infant Kaiju\\'s brain and handle the strain of the experience together.<br/><br/>Plans are soon made to set up the Gipsy Danger and Striker Eureka to deliver the warhead to the undersea rift. With his father unable to pilot Striker due to a broken arm, Herc Hansen is left without a partner. Pentecost surprises everyone when he takes the role. However, the strain of piloting a Jaeger could prove fatal to Pentecost, but he volunteers anyway.<br/><br/>As the two Jaegers near the rift, Geiszler and Gottlieb rush into the Shatterdome\\'s control room, and explain that the plan will not work. The channel between dimensions will only allow in a Kaiju, the very reason for the previous failures to destroy the channel with other nuclear weapons: if they attempt to drop the warhead into the channel, it\\'ll just deflect off the breach. The two Jaegers battle two Category 4 Kaiju guarding the rift as a third Kaiju, a Category 5, larger and more powerful than the previous creatures, emerges.<br/><br/>Gipsy Danger and Striker Eureka sustain heavy damage in the battle. Unable to deliver the bomb, Striker Eureka detonates it to take out the defending Kaiju and give Gipsy Danger a chance to enter the rift. Once inside, Raleigh and Mako will detonate Gipsy\\'s nuclear reactor and destroy the rift. Gipsy attaches itself to the Category 5 Kaiju and fall with it into the rift, bypassing the code that would reject any non-kaiju. Inside the Kaiju dimension, Raleigh ejects Mako in a life pod and manually initiates the detonation of the nuclear core. As Gypsy Danger enters the other dimension, Raleigh ejects in his own pod before Gipsy Danger explodes and collapses the rift, ending the Kaiju threat once and for all. On the surface of the Pacific Ocean, both pods reach the surface. For a brief period it seems that Raleigh may be dead but he awakens, much to Mako\\'s joy.<br/><br/>A mid-credits scene reveals that Hannibal Chau has survived being swallowed by the baby Kaiju by cutting his way out with a pocket knife. He angrily asks where the shoe he lost is.</div></div>'}\n",

At the work, Trevor found that his brother\\'s lab is being shut down because of a lack of funding. So, he comes home and sits in a chair to relax and found some messages on the answering machine. When he plays that recording, he found that the messages are from Liz (Max\\'s wife and Sean\\'s mother). He is forgotten that his nephew Sean is coming to spend some days with him. When Liz drops Sean, she leaves Trevor with a box of items that belonged to Max (Trevor\\'s brother and Sean\\'s father) who disappeared years before. Sean takes interest when Trevor says about his father, whom he never really had a chance to meet. Inside the box, Trevor discovers a couple of things. In that, he found the novel Journey to the Centre of the Earth by Jules Verne. Inside the book, he finds notes written by his brother. So, he goes to his laboratory to find out more information on the notes. There he decides that he must go to Iceland to investigate further.\\nHe decides to send Sean back to his mother, but Sean protest it, so he decides to bring Sean with him. They started looking for another volcanologist. When they get to that scientist, they meet his daughter Hannah, who informs them he is dead. She tells them that both her father and Max believed in that book. After some discussion, she offers to help them climb up to the instrument which suddenly started sending data. While hiking the mountain a lightning storm arrives and forces three of them into a cave. Because the lightning storm hit the cave, its entrance got collapses and trapping them inside the cave. So, they do not have any alternative way except to go deeper into the cave, which turns out in an abandoned mine.<br/><br/>So, the three of them decide to go deeper into the cave to investigate for Hannah farther and Max into the mine. Suddenly they found a hole in a wall after hitting a trolly on the dead-end of the mine. While investigating the fall into a deep pit, taking them to the \"Centre of the Earth\". They all continue the travel until they discover a cave that Max lived in. They found some old journal of Max, meanwhile, Hannah discovers Max\\'s dead body. So, they all bury him. At that point, Trevor reads a message from the journal that was written by Max on Sean\\'s 3rd birthday. While reading Max\\'s journal they realize that they must quickly leave, as the temperature is continuously increasing.<br/><br/>Trevor figures out that they must find a steam power that can send them to the surface, and it must be done in 48 hours, or all of the water which creates the steam will be gone. Also, must do this before the temperature rises past 135 degrees. They begin by crossing the underground ocean, and suddenly the Trevor and Hannah got separated from Sean. So now Sean\\'s guide is a little bird who has been present since the three of them entered the Centre. After Sean comes closer to the river, he encounters a Tyrannosaurus. Trevor who is searching for him saves by digging a hole in the wall and putting the Tyrannosaurus in a big hole. When they arrive at the river, they found it is dried up and all the water is on the other side of a wall.<br/><br/>Trevor uses a flare to fire the magnesium in the wall and take out the water to create a powerful steam pressure to shoot them outside that place. When they throw out from that pit and destroy the home of an Italian man, they found that it was Italy where they have landed. Sean gives him a diamond (which he had found earlier in the caves) for the penalty of the destroyed house. Trevor founds that Sean has many more in his backpack, and they can be used for funding his brother\\'s laboratory. At the end of this movie, Trevor hand over a book titled \"Atlantis\" on the final day of Sean\\'s visit with him (and Hannah), suggesting they could hang out during Christmas break.</div></div>'}\n",

In the present day, aboard a space station, a lab rat has been mutated with CRISPR and has wiped out the entire crew. Dr. Kerry Atkins (Marley Shelton) is the sole survivor, and she is contacting the heads at Energyne (the ones who developed the CRISPR mutagen) to help her return. Energyne\\'s CEO Claire Wyden (Malin Akerman) orders Kerry to bring back the mutagen samples, or to not return at all. Kerry goes back for the samples, and the rat monster chases her. She makes it to the escape pod and is released as the station blows up with the rat still inside, but the damage to the pod causes it to break open, depressurize, and explode, killing Kerry. The samples themselves fly away across the country.<br/><br/>At an animal sanctuary in San Diego, primatologist Davis Okoye (Dwayne \\'The Rock\\' Johnson) leads co-workers Nelson (PJ Byrne), Connor (Jack Quaid), and Amy (Breanne Hill) to an ape enclosure. They observe an ape named Pavo who attempts to find a female ape to mate with, but Davis splits them up. Pavo is upset until Davis talks him down gently. Just then, an albino gorilla named George comes running in, which leads to Connor freaking out and upsetting Pavo, who runs after Connor until George knocks him over. George frightens Pavo until Davis talks to him as well. George turns out to be playful, and Davis considers him his best friend.<br/><br/>After work, Amy tries to invite Davis out for drinks, but he kindly turns her down. Nelson then approaches him and asks why he is closer to animals than he is with people. Davis says the animals just get him.<br/><br/>That night, the mutagen samples start to land. One lands in George\\'s enclosure, another in the forest near a pack of wolves, and the last one in a river in Florida. A lone wolf is sprayed with the gas while a crocodile eats the whole sample, and George gets sprayed with it as well.<br/><br/>Davis is called in the next morning to check on George. Nelson tells him George is in the grizzly bear enclosure. They find a dead bear in there, and George hiding in fear. He has a scratch mark on his chest and indicates to Davis that the bear attacked him first. George steps out and has now grown up to nine feet tall.<br/><br/>News reports of the mutagen hitting the country has hit. Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris) sees the news on TV, as does Claire Wyden and her brother Brett (Jake Lacy). Brett is freaking out over the amount of money they are losing, while Claire is satisfied that the mutagen for her \"Project Rampage\" experiment is successful. In order to handle what might happen next, Claire suggests they hire a private military group to fix things.<br/><br/>Kate goes to the animal sanctuary to try and talk to Davis about what has happened, as she claims to work for Energyne and is responsible for developing the mutagen, so she may be able to stop George from growing. When they try to go and find George, he is caged up until he starts to grow more aggressive. He eventually breaks free from the cage and runs loose on the sanctuary, terrifying all the guests. Davis runs after him just as the cops arrive. They aim their guns at George until Davis manages to talk George down. Things get worse as a chopper flies overhead and starts hitting George with tranquilizer darts until he passes out.<br/><br/>In Wyoming, the military group, led by Burke (Joe Manganiello), heads into the forest to recover the mutagen sample. Burke contacts the Wydens and informs them that the container is empty. As the team moves deeper into the forest, they discover dead wolves sprawled out across the ground, as well as a massive paw print in the ground. They are then found and attacked by the mutated wolf - nicknamed Ralph - as he runs through the forest. The team shoots at him but their efforts are futile as Ralph picks them off one by one until only Burke remains. He calls to the chopper to shoot at Ralph, but the wolf leaps out of the trees and wrecks the chopper, causing it to crash down into the lake. Burke is then cornered by Ralph, and he attempts to take one last stand, but Ralph devours him.<br/><br/>A government agent named Harvey Russell (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) arrives at the sanctuary to bring George onto a plane to keep him contained from the public. Davis and Kate are taken in for questioning as well. Davis argues that having George on the plane is suicide, but Russell thinks they have everything under control. In the air, Russell reveals, after looking through Davis and Kate\\'s records, that Kate had been fired from Energyne after attempting to steal research from the labs, for which she served 13 months in prison. This leads Davis to realize she was lying and that she can\\'t fix George.<br/><br/>After learning of the wolf incident, Claire activates a radio frequency that calls to the mutated animals. Ralph and the crocodile - known as Lizzie - make their way to Chicago, where Energyne is located. George, despite being kept sedated, manages to hear the frequency as well and he starts to wake up. He goes into full rage mode and breaks the cage down. He attacks the agents as Davis tries to keep himself and Kate safe. George almost kills Russell until Davis intervenes, and George merely knocks Russell out. The plane\\'s turbine blows out, and it starts to head down. Davis straps parachutes onto himself, Kate, and Russell, and they eject themselves from the plane as it crashes to the ground.<br/><br/>The three land and see that George survived the crash and is making his way to the city. Davis makes it clear that he doesn\\'t trust Kate after what he\\'s learned about her. She explains that while she was working for Energyne, her brother was stricken with cancer, and she hoped that CRISPR might cure him until she learned that Claire had been using CRISPR to develop dangerous weapons. Kate tried to make off with it but was caught and locked up. Davis then tells her how he found George. Poachers got his mother, and a scared young George was hiding under the poachers\\' truck. Davis and his team recovered him and killed the poachers as they had first shot at them. Russell awakens and is thankful to Davis for saving his life, so he decides to help him and Kate.<br/><br/>Davis, Kate, and Russell meet with a military team that is keeping surveillance on George and Ralph as they head into Chicago. They realize the animals are being called into the city, and that they must find a way to contain them. Russell helps Davis and Kate steal a chopper and make their way into the city.<br/><br/>George, Ralph, and Lizzie arrive in the city, leading to an all-out RAMPAGE. Davis and Kate arrive as the monsters start tearing the city apart. Knowing there\\'s no way they\\'ll be able to stop them on their own, they head to Energyne to find the antidote that can stop them. Davis lands the chopper, and they run into the building amidst the chaos. They find the lab with the antidote, but the Wydens find them first, and Brett holds them at gunpoint. Claire tells the two that the antidote won\\'t make the animals return to normal, but it will only remove their heightened aggressions. takes the gun and shoots Davis in the abdomen before taking Kate with her.<br/><br/>The Wydens attempt to board their own chopper and make off with their materials and Kate, but the monsters start making their way up the tower. George makes it to the top and smashes the chopper, leading Brett to run away. Davis appears after surviving the gunshot and he saves Kate, but Claire is forcing them to help her. Instead, Davis distracts George long enough for Kate to take a vial of the antidote that she recovered and place it in Claire\\'s bag. Kate punches Claire and shoves her into George\\'s path so that he grabs Claire and eats her, along with the antidote. Meanwhile, Brett is almost out the door when he comes across Russell, who somehow made it quickly into the city. He orders Brett to hand over the laptop containing his research so that he can be free. Brett happily obliges and runs out the door...only to get messily splattered by a piece of falling debris.<br/><br/>Davis and Kate wait for the antidote to take effect as George continues to destroy, while Ralph and Lizzie make it to the top as well. Davis and Kate board the Wydens\\' chopper so that they can get enough air to avoid any serious damage. The monsters all cause the tower to collapse and go crashing down. Davis and Kate survive, and George emerges from the rubble, now back to his old self. However, Ralph and Lizzie are still rampaging, so Davis and George decide it\\'s time to put an end to this. It also turns out that the military is trying to launch an airstrike to take out the monsters, so Kate joins Russell in trying to call it off.<br/><br/>George battles Ralph and Lizzie. He tosses Ralph around, but the wolf can fly and shoot quills, while Lizzie is the biggest of them all and is nigh indestructible. Davis tricks Ralph into gliding toward him, only for Davis to move and let Ralph fly into Lizzie\\'s path. The croc grabs Ralph by the throat and bites his head off, swallowing it. George attempts to pound Lizzie, but she is too strong and she tosses George against a pole that impales him. Davis throws a grenade belt at Lizzie\\'s neck and also tries using the chopper\\'s artillery to take her down, but it barely scratches her. Lizzie goes after Davis and nearly eats him until George leaps into the air with the pole, and he rams it into Lizzie\\'s eye and runs it through her head, finally killing her.<br/><br/>After seeing everything that happened, the military colonel calls off the strike. George appears weakened from his wound and apparently dies, only to reveal he was just messing with Davis. The heroes start to leave the city as they wonder where George\\'s new home will be.</div></div>'}\n",

Her current work with SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, is based on that love and is in part an homage to her father. Ever since funding from the National Science Foundation (N.S.F.) was pulled from the project, which was referred to as \"more science fiction than science\" by some, including her N.S.F. superior David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt), Ellie and her rogue scientist colleagues have looked for funding from where ever they could get it to continue their work. When Ellie and her colleagues hear chatter originating from the vicinity of the star Vega, Ellie feels vindicated. But that vindication is short lived when others, including politicians, the military, religious leaders, and rival scientists, such as Drumlin, try to take over her work. After the mysterious messages from space are decoded by her anonymous millionaire donor, S.R. Hadden (Sir John Hurt), the project takes on a whole new dimension, which strengthens for Ellie the quest for answers.<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=Huggo&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_2\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Huggo</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">The skeptical scientist Dr. Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) researches extraterrestrial life with her team in Puerto Rico.

An anonymous millionaire provides the necessary funds and Ellie proceeds with her work. Four years later, she is contacted by alien forms from Vega that send a coded message. The millionaire, S.R. Hadden (Sir John Hurt) that is financing the research deciphers the message and gives to Ellie the design of an intriguing machine. Ellie concludes that the equipment might be to transport a passenger to Vega. Now she needs to convince a commission formed by military, politicians, scientists, and religious leaders that she is the best candidate for the journey.<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=Claudio%20Carvalho%2C%20Rio%20de%20Janeiro%2C%20Brazil&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_3\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">After having lost her faith in God irrevocably, the esteemed astronomer, Dr Ellie Arroway, develops a different approach towards the existence of life outside the Earth\\'s confined boundaries.

The shot suddenly begins to travel outwards from Earth at impossible speed, passing Mars, the Asteroid Belt of the Solar System, Jupiter, travelling through Saturn\\'s rings and leaving our Solar System. Travel continues even faster, seemingly faster than light, passing the Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula and out of the Milky Way galaxy. The trip passes through another galaxy, finally showing us a field of thousands of galaxies. After a few moments we pass through the iris of a young girl, Ellie Arroway, who is reciting a HAM radio greeting \"C-Q\" (\"seek you\") in her bedroom.<br/><br/>Ellie has a gift for science and is encouraged by her kindly father to communicate with people in distant cities on her HAM. Ellie makes contact with someone in Pensacola, Florida, her longest communication yet at over a thousand miles from her home near Madison, Wisconsin. That night Ellie asks if she could ever have a transmitter powerful enough to talk to her deceased mother (who died in childbirth). Her father says he doesn\\'t know but suggests that Ellie is tenacious enough that she probably could accomplish such a task one day.<br/><br/>Ellie\\'s father dies one night while they stargaze. Ellie seems to blame herself for not getting her father his heart medication in time. Ellie grows up to become a brilliant astrophysicist, earns her doctorate and begins her research with SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute) at Arecibo in Puerto Rico. Joining her there is another astrophysicist, Kent, who is blind but has exceptional hearing.<br/><br/>At Arecibo, Ellie meets influential spiritual ponderer Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), and has an intense, brief, but detached (on her part) affair with him. One day while looking in a Cracker Jack box, he finds a toy compass and gives it to her, \"so she wont lose her way\" and that it might save her life one day. Palmer wants to get closer to Ellie in terms of a relationship, but Ellie is more preoccupied with her search for extra-terrestrial life. Shortly after, Ellie is angered when her supervisor, David Drumlin, pulls her team\\'s funding. She gets in a heated debate defending her work, to which Drumlin chastises her for spending time on \\'nonsense.\\'<br/><br/>Taking action, Ellie and her team pool together to try and get funding for their project from private sources. Ellie and her team spend 18 months searching, before finding their benefactor in the form of S. R. Hadden (John Hurt), a billionaire investor who had been known for innovation and had fallen out of favor in the scientific community. While giving a presentation to the Hadden Industries board of directors, Ellie becomes confrontational when it seems the board has no interest in funding her project. One of the board members receives an unexpected phone call and tells Ellie that she has her funding. Ellie looks at a nearby observation camera and mouths \"Thank you.\"<br/><br/>Hadden\\'s funding allows Ellie to have access to the \\'Very Large Array\\' (VLA) in New Mexico, a facility with 27 large radio antenna dishes which Ellie uses to continue her search. Even here, Drumlin and the scientific community are not far behind. With 4 years of finding nothing, and even though all funding for the project is privatized by Hadden Industries, and because of Ellie\\'s relentless pursuit and reputation for bizarre experiments, the project is still in danger of being shut down after Drumlin convinces the scientific community that it\\'s a waste of resources. Even so, Ellie vows not to quit.<br/><br/>One evening, while listening intently, Ellie hears a powerful signal. She and her team analyze the signal which begins to transmit a prime number pattern. They determine that it\\'s emanating from the star Vega, confirmed by others the world over, undeniable and strong in its pulsing power, which is much like a heart beating. Other astronomers in world-wide countries are utilized to record the signal, since the VLA is only aligned to Vega for a certain amount of time. Shortly thereafter, Drumlin inserts himself into the situation, taking credit for Ellie\\'s work. Ellie is also pressured by the president\\'s National Security Adviser, Michael Kitz (James Woods) who wishes to militarize the project, feeling that due to other countries having heard the message, Ellie has compromised national security. The message, however, is transmitted in pulses equaling prime numbers, to wit Ellie explains that mathematics is a universal language, proving the message was not meant strictly for the United States or its government.<br/><br/>Kitz and his assistant Rachel Constantine (Angela Bassett) inform the President when a video feed of Hitler is found mixed into the prime number pulse pattern. It is from the 1936 Olympics, the first television signal strong enough to leave the atmosphere, but the implications are threatening. They ponder if the alien intelligence is seeing an ally in Hitler, or merely bouncing the signal back to Earth. Religious right mouthpiece Richard Rank (Rob Lowe) reports that the fundamentalist camp is wary. At the same time, huge crowds of people descend on the VLA compound in New Mexico, trying to hear the signal. Some come for support, others, such as a religious zealot named Joseph (Jake Busey), have come to condemn Ellie and the others, preaching against science and claiming that god exists in Vega.<br/><br/>A short time later it is found that interlaced within the TV signal, are a number of pages of digital data, over 60,000 in total. Ellie is then given authority over the deciphering, but after many months, the edges of the pages do not seem capable of lining up. Ellie soon gets her answer in the form of Hadden himself, who meets with Ellie privately. Hadden shows considerable knowledge of Ellie herself, saying that he prefers to know as much as he can about his investments. (One of the video clips he uses is that of Ellie presenting to his corporation\\'s board, indicating that he made the phone call that got Ellie her funding.) Ellie is initially confrontational, saying that Hadden had compromised the security surrounding the project but seems to back off a bit when Hadden tells her he\\'s dying and wants to give something back to the world, which he exploited for decades building his fortune.<br/><br/>Hadden then explains that Ellie and her team had been deciphering the pages in only two dimensions. The pages it seems, were created in three dimensions by an intelligence that would work in that manner for efficiency. With this revelation, Ellie is able to find the \"primer\", or the key to decoding the alien\\'s message. Within the pages, there appear to be some form of blueprints. While Ellie speculates they could be a transport, Kitz and his security detail feel it could be a weapon of some kind, falling back on speculation that any alien life forms would be hostile to mankind.<br/><br/>The decryption team is able to determine that the plans are indeed for a type of transport and contain an image of a human-like figure. Construction of the machine is estimated to cost as much as about 300 billion dollars, with a number of countries vying for the ability to join in construction, or to have a representative from their country vie for the chance to travel in the machine.<br/><br/>A special panel is convened to select the appropriate candidate for the trip. Ellie is surprised when Drumlin resigns his post to become a candidate. Ellie is also a candidate, and makes it to the final round. Palmer (who is on the panel) cripples Ellie\\'s chances of being selected by asking her if she believes in God. Ellie indirectly answers the question by not stating a direct answer. Her falter is then picked up by Drumlin, who then speaks \\'passionately,\\' using God in his closing remarks. His \\'grandstanding\\' attitude towards the panel works, and he is chosen to go. Ellie feels betrayed by Palmer, who states that he couldn\\'t choose someone who doesn\\'t believe in God. Ellie angrily tells him that she told the truth, whereas Drumlin just told them what they wanted to hear. She then returns the compass he gave her.<br/><br/>After a few years of construction the enormous machine is completed at Cape Canaveral, and it\\'s first test-run is televised on all major news networks. While Drumlin is supervising the test from the machine, Ellie is allowed to be part of the test\\'s control team at NASA\\'s Mission Control. All seems to be going well in testing, until Joseph (who Ellie had seen previously preaching against the project at the VLA in New Mexico) is spotted on security cameras in the machine\\'s gantry, dressed in a stolen technician\\'s uniform and with explosives strapped to his chest. Drumlin and a number of men try to subdue him, but Joseph detonates the explosives, destroying the machine and those conducting the test inside the machine, including Drumlin.<br/><br/>Ellie returns to the VLA, saddened that her discovery or any chance of making contact appears to have been destroyed. That evening, she is surprised to find a satellite uplink in her apartment. The uplink connects her to the MIR Space Station, which has now become home to S.R. Hadden, as a way to try and slow the terminal cancer that is \\'eating him alive.\\' Happily, Hadden shows Ellie that his company had secretly constructed a second machine in secret on the island of Hokkaido in Japan, and that he wants her to take the trip this time.<br/><br/>Ellie is flown to a special ship just off the site, where she is met by the machine\\'s crew, and given a pre-flight rundown, showing her everything from survival gear, to a suicide pill in case she is marooned in space. Shortly before the trip, she is reunited with Palmer, who returns her compass that she gave him during their last meeting. He then reveals that he has come to care about her, and that previously, he hadn\\'t wanted her to go, fearing she might not ever return.<br/><br/>Ellie is then put into the transport pod. The startup and running of the machine prove to be very powerful and video/audio contact with Ellie is nearly lost in the tremendous energy the machine projects. She repeats that she\\'s \"Okay to go!\" and is heard by Kent, who can just make out her voice within the interference. The pod is launched into the center of the machine, she appears to travel through several wormholes, seeing bits of alien machinery, and a city on a distant planet of some kind. At one point, Ellie separates herself from the restraint chair in the pod to retrieve Palmer\\'s compass which had come loose from her neck. The chair breaks violently apart from its fastenings and slams into the pod\\'s side, fulfilling Palmer\\'s prediction that the compass would one day save her life. As Ellie stares through a wall of the pod, its translucency reveals a brilliant, celestial event. Before she realizes it, she drifts to a gentle landing on a sandy beach environment (similar to the one she drew of Pensacola as a little girl). Suddenly, she notices a shimmering image moving towards her. As it draws near, she is shocked to see that it is her father.<br/><br/>However, she soon determines that everything (the beach, the image of her Father) is not real, but memories and thoughts taken from her mind by the alien (who has taken on the guise of her Father). He explains that this was a way to allow them to make things more comfortable for her. The alien reveals that the broadcast signal from the 1936 Olympics was how the aliens knew about Earth, and that there are many others out in space. When Ellie asks about the transport system, the alien explains that their race found it, but they have no idea who built it. The alien explains that in examining her memories, that humans feel \\'so alone.\\' But to the aliens the one thing they\\'ve found that brings them comfort is each other. The alien explains that Ellie has to go home. However, she tries to ask more questions, but is told by the alien that she has taken the first step, and in time, mankind will make another, and find out more. \"That\\'s the way it\\'s been done for billions of years,\" he explains. The sky above the beach begins to swirl back into another worm hole and she vanishes.<br/><br/>The pod lands in the netting at the bottom of the machine. The mission director tells her that there was a malfunction. Asking to know how long she was gone, she is shocked when she\\'s told the pod simply dropped straight through the machine. Footage from a number of video cameras confirms it, and a video recorder that was in her communications headpiece only recorded static.<br/><br/>After these events, Kitz resigns from his post as National Security Adviser, and holds an inquiry to find out \\'what really happened.\\' During the inquiry, Kitz assumes that the entire event was a hoax: from the alien message to the construction blueprints. His feelings are that it was all a scheme perpetrated by S.R. Hadden, maybe in some crazed idea to unite the world (Hadden is unable to be presented to the panel, as he has since died onboard MIR, finally succumbing to cancer). Even with Kitz demanding answers, Ellie explains that without any evidence or proof, she firmly believes that she did travel to Vega, and that she did experience the meeting with the other being and wishes she could share the experience with all of humanity. The hearing ends, and Palmer is there to accompany her. Outside the Capitol building in Washington, a number of people are there, many in support of Ellie\\'s theory. As she is put into a car, Palmer is asked his opinion. Stating that since he is a \\'man of faith,\\' he is bound by a different covenant than Ellie. But even so, he does state that he believes her.<br/><br/>In the aftermath of the inquiry, Kitz is in a discussion with Rachel Constantine. After discussing the investigation committee\\'s findings, Rachel explains to Kitz how it appears that he overlooked the portion of the report regarding Ellie\\'s video recorder. While Kitz said that it had just recorded static, Rachel has discovered in the report that it actually recorded 18 hours of static, the precise amount of time Ellie believed her journey had taken.<br/><br/>Ellie is shortly thereafter given a grant to continue her work. She gives a group of grade school students a tour of the VLA facility. When one of them asks her if there could be life in outer space, she echoes her father\\'s sentiment from when she was young, \"If there isn\\'t, then it\\'d be an awful waste of space.\"<br/><br/>The ending of the film cuts to some time later on.

Monarch now watches over Kong, who resides within a giant dome. He is visited by Jia, the last Iwi native and the adopted daughter of Dr. Ilene Andrews, who is deaf and can communicate with Kong via sign language.<br/><br/>Bernie Hayes, a former employee of Apex Cybernetics and host of a Titan conspiracy theory podcast, exfiltrates information suggesting sinister activities at a Pensacola Apex facility. However, Godzilla suddenly attacks the facility; during the rampage, Bernie discovers a device that resembles the ORCA, previously used to communicate with or control Titans.<br/><br/>Madison Russell enlists her friend Josh to investigate the cause of Godzilla\\'s attack. Together, they find Bernie and sneak into the wrecked Apex base, discovering a secret facility deep underground. The trio are inadvertently locked and transported in a container carrying Skullcrawler eggs, two-legged reptilian megafauna that was previously discovered by Monarch, through an underground tunnel to Hong Kong.<br/><br/>There, they unknowingly intrude on a test of Mechagodzilla, a mechanical version of Godzilla, telepathically controlled by Ren Serizawa, the son of the late Ishiro Serizawa, through the neural networks of Ghidorah derived from a severed head that Apex had managed to retrieve. The test is cut short due to limitations of the power supply. Walter Simmons, CEO of Apex, intends to harness to power of an energy source in the Hollow Earth, an underground world that is below the Earth and the secret home to the Titans, to overcome the limitations of Mechagodzilla.<br/><br/>Walter recruits Nathan Lind, a former Monarch scientist turned theorist on the Hollow Earth, as a guide in search of a new power source within the Hollow Earth. Although Nathan is initially hesitant because his brother tried to explore Hollow Earth but a strong anti-gravity field inside the tunnel killed him, he agrees after Walter reveals that APEX has developed HEAVs, specialized crafts to withstand the pressure exerts by the gravity field which killed Nathan\\'s brother.<br/><br/>Nathan goes to Skull Island and meets with Ilene, convincing her to let Kong guide them through the Hollow Earth. Nathan, Ilene, and an Apex team led by Walter\\'s daughter Maya board a modified barge with Kong chained and lightly sedated. However, Godzilla attacks the convoy midway through the voyage and defeats Kong, but only retreats after the ships disable their power and trick him into thinking they are destroyed. Realizing that Godzilla will continue to come for Kong if he is deemed a threat, they change plans and airlift Kong to a Hollow Earth entry point in Antarctica. Jia convinces Kong to enter the tunnel and the team follows him in the HEAVs.<br/><br/>Inside Hollow Earth, they find an ecosystem similar to Skull Island. While traversing through the landscape, Kong and the team discover his species\\' ancestral throne room that depicts an ancient war with Godzilla\\'s kind; they also find a glowing axe made from the dorsal plates of another Godzilla. Kong discovers that the power source can recharge the axe. The Apex team sends the power source\\'s signature back to their base in Hong Kong, but Godzilla, sensing the energy, makes landfall in Hong Kong and directly attacks the throne room. Maya and the rest of the Apex team are killed by Kong whilst avoiding Godzilla\\'s attack.<br/><br/>Kong and the survivors, Ilene, Jia and Nathan, escape through the hole to Hong Kong, where Godzilla and Kong fight again. The battle ends with Kong being overpowered and severely injured by Godzilla.<br/><br/>In the Apex base, Ren warns Walter that they have not tested the new Hollow Earth energy source, fearing the consequences. However, Walter ignores his pleas and orders him to activate Mechagodzilla. Bernie, Madison, and Josh are caught by security and brought to Walter. Mechagodzilla goes haywire under the influence of the energy source and Ghidorah\\'s neural networks, electrocuting Ren to death. Mechagodzilla completely awakens and kills Walter, emerging from the base of Victoria Peak to attack the city.<br/><br/>Godzilla and Mechagodzilla battle, with Godzilla quickly becoming overwhelmed due to exhaustion from his previous battle with Kong. Kong is revived and is convinced by Jia that Godzilla is not an enemy. Godzilla blasts Kong\\'s axe with his atomic breath, supercharging it and allowing Kong to decapitate and destroy Mechagodzilla.<br/><br/>Madison, Bernie, and Josh reunite with Madison\\'s father Mark, while Godzilla and Kong acknowledge each other before going their separate ways. Sometime later, Ilene and Jia watch Kong, now ruling over the Hollow Earth, from an observation post.</div></div>'}\n",

Driving her car off a bridge, Julie kills herself and horribly disfigures David.

With growing unease he drives to Times Square and finds the entire city abandoned. He then awakens in his bedroom once again to realize he\\'s only been having a vivid dream.<br/><br/>Cut to: David in a jail cell describing a dream to Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell), a psychologist who has been assigned to him. David has been charged with a murder he cannot remember, and he wears a mysterious pale mask. He and Dr. McCabe discuss the events that led to his eventual incarceration. Following the death of David\\'s father, he was given 51% ownership of his father\\'s publishing company. The rest of the company is owned by a board of directors that David disparagingly calls the \"Seven Dwarfs.\" Each of them believed that he was next in line to take over the company after David\\'s father died. David can have anything his heart desires, and nothing is beyond him.<br/><br/>On the night of his birthday party which also includes a conversation with a drunken Thomas Tipp (Timothy Spall), the company attorney and an old friend of David\\'s father, David considered firing Thomas for what he believes is his incompetence as an attorney, but he has a change of heart when Thomas makes a sad confession.<br/><br/>David\\'s best friend, Brian Shelby (Jason Lee), brings with him a girl named Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz) whom he just met at the library. Almost instantly, David and Sofia flirt with each other, almost completely ignoring Brian. However, Julianna Gianni (Cameron Diaz), a regular bed partner for whom David has no deep feelings, crashes his party. She stays distant but keeps a close eye on him the entire night. Once David realizes Julianna is there, he asks Sofia to pretend to engage in a deep conversation with him so that Julianna won\\'t come near him. David and Sofia end up hitting it off. David walks Sofia back to her place, where they stay up all night talking.<br/><br/>The next morning as David is getting ready to drive to work, Julianna drives up beside him asking how his night with Sofia was. Julianna makes David feel guilty about ignoring her and convinces him to get into her car. It quickly becomes apparent that she is obsessed with David. She starts driving recklessly, speeding through busy city streets, all the while insisting that she\\'s deeply in love with him and berating him for treating her so casually. Fearing for their safety, he tries to get her to stop the car by telling her that he loves her. She drives the car off a bridge in an attempt to kill them both.<br/><br/>Julianna did not survive the crash. David did, however, although his face and right arm are mangled, and he suffers blinding headaches due to the metal pieces holding his skull together. He spends a long time in isolation before deciding to take back control of his company and see Sofia again. She appears hesitant to be around him, and when they go on a date she brings Brian along. The date is a disaster as David drinks too much and makes Sofia increasingly uneasy around him. The three part ways at the end of the night, and David ends up passing out on a sidewalk. It is morning when Sofia wakes him up at that same exact spot and tells him that she will stay with him if he can get his act together. From that moment on, David\\'s life is turned around. His team of plastic surgeons is able to restore his face and he finds his soul mate in Sofia.<br/><br/>David\\'s new-found happiness is short-lived, however, when he begins hallucinating. He looks in the mirror to see his face once again disfigured. A mysterious man (Noah Taylor) turns up wherever he goes and tells David that he has the power to control the world. And one night he goes to bed with Sofia and wakes up to find himself with Julianna, who insists she really is Sofia. He grows violent, convinced that Julianna is alive and playing games with him. He is arrested and told by Tipp that he severely beat Sofia, but Tipp will have the case thrown out. Tipp shows David photos of Julianna with a bruised face, but everybody, including his best friend Brian, tells him that it was Sofia he attacked.<br/><br/>David breaks into Sofia\\'s apartment and finds that every photo he\\'d seen of Sofia is now of Julianna. Julianna attacks him thinking he\\'s an intruder but then apologizes while still insisting she is Sofia. She leaves the room and the actual Sofia returns in her place as if nothing unusual had happened. They begin to make love but while they are in the middle of the act he finds that he is making love to Julianna. In a fit of panic he suffocates her and then discovers he has just killed Sofia.<br/><br/>When David is finished telling Dr. McCabe his story he still can\\'t bring himself to believe that he killed anybody. Dr. McCabe, frustrated by David\\'s failure to tell him anything meaningful that might help his case, tells him that he can no longer help David and will try to argue for \"temporary derangement\". This odd turn of legalistic phrase is just one of many clues that in this version of David\\'s world all is not what it seems. As Dr. McCabe leaves, David sees an infomercial for a cryonics company called \"Life Extension.\" This infomercial involving a dog that has been frozen and brought back to life has appeared at several points throughout the film. David is entranced by the commercial, and McCabe sees that there may be a connection between Life Extension and David\\'s amnesia.<br/><br/>Escorted by Dr. McCabe and the police, David visits Life Extension and realizes that he had signed on as a client. He had opted for an extra feature called the Lucid Dream. This allows cryogenically-frozen, clinically dead clients to experience an unending custom-made dream life with no memory of their physical death.<br/><br/>David realizes that he is now living in the Lucid Dream and that the mysterious man is his \"Technical Support.\" The Support Technician explains that the Lucid Dream was \"spliced\" into his memories at the point where he passed out on the sidewalk after his night out with Sofia and Brian. But the dream went awry and turned into a nightmare. Since nothing he experienced after the splice was real David realizes that he never murdered anybody. Dr. McCabe tells him that the guilt he felt for the way he treated Julianna may have caused his subconscious to merge Julianna and Sofia. But it turns out that Dr. McCabe isn\\'t real either; he\\'s just a character David created in his dream to be the father figure he always wanted. Most curious is the fact that Dr. McCabe seems to believe that he himself is real and only reluctantly comes to accept the truth (he had previously mentioned that he was going out with his two daughters for dinner after a session with David, but when The Support Technician asks him \"What are their [your daughters\\'] names, Dr. McCabe has no response). Tech Support tells David that in reality, he never saw Sofia again, and that Thomas Tipp, the attorney that David considered firing in the beginning, had saved the company for David and helped him regain control from the board of directors. But David, suffering constant pain and depression following his disfigurement, committed suicide.<br/><br/>In the end, technical support reveals an upgrade to the software which allows David to either be reinserted into the lucid dream with no memory of the nightmare portion or to be awakened in the present time (which is 150 years after he was frozen) and live in the real world with a restored body. David chooses to be awakened in this future present realizing that everyone he ever knew will be long dead and his wealth will be worth far less. After one last lucid-dream rooftop exchange with Sofia in which she vows to \"find you again\" he leaps off the skyscraper. Multiple memory-images cascade frenetically through his mind as he falls. The final shot is of a brief whiteout (rather than the blackout) accompanied by the sound of a woman\\'s voice telling him to \"open your eyes\" and an extreme closeup of a single human eye opening and staring into the camera.</div></div>'}\n",

We see moments of Louise with her daughter Hannah, from her birth, through her childhood years, up until her death at a young age from a fatal disease (presumably cancer).<br/><br/>Louise is a linguist and language professor. She begins her lecture to a small class when the students\\' phones go off. One student asks Louise to turn on the news. It is reported that in at least 12 sites around the world, there are enormous extraterrestrial vessels touching down.<br/><br/>The next day, Louise is visited in her office by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to utilize her linguistic skills to attempt to communicate with the aliens. At night, Weber shows up in a helicopter to escort Louise to the base. She joins them and meets a theoretical physicist named Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner).<br/><br/>The team arrives at the Montana landing site, while the other 11 sites around the world have bases set up as well and are continuously updating each other on any progress. Louise, Ian, and several others are brought up to the top of the pod, where the lack of gravity allows them to stand before the glass-like barrier that keeps the aliens back. Two aliens appear. They are surrounded by a mist and they appear as large tentacled creatures (later called \"heptapods\"). Louise attempts to communicate with them by writing \"human\" on a board. One of the creatures emits a black cloud that forms a circular symbol. In a bold move, Louise removes her hazmat suit, attempting to gain their trust. She press her palm to the barrier. One of the creatures extends a limb and presses it against the barrier in an imitation of Louise\\'s gesture. After Ian shucks his hazmat suit, he decides to call the two aliens \"Abbott and Costello.\"<br/><br/>Tensions rise around the country as uncertainty in the heptapods\\' intentions has sparked panic, causing people to loot and riot.<br/><br/>As the sessions go on, the team records the symbols produced by the heptapods to determine which symbols are translations of the words that Louise has been teaching them (\"love\", \"time\", etc.). Later when Louise \"touches\" them again, she starts to see visions of Hannah.<br/><br/>China\\'s General Shang (Tzi Ma) doesn\\'t trust the aliens and has his team deviate from the set plan by ceasing communication of the intelligence they gather to the other world sites. The Chinese site attempts to communicate with the heptapods through a game of mahjong.<br/><br/>Louise starts to experience dreams in the alien language, while still seeing memories of Hannah as a child showing Louise a drawing of her parents in a TV show she made up. Hannah asks Louise if it\\'s her fault that her father left, but Louise assures her that\\'s not the case. In the present, Louise questions the aliens as to who this girl is.<br/><br/>The aliens deliver a message that is translated to \"Use weapon\", which generates even greater tension among the other sites. The Chinese deliver an ultimatum to the aliens - they have 24 hours to leave, or the military will initiate a strike. Several other sites gear up to do the same thing, while the sites all disconnect from each other. Louise tells Weber that they need to make sure the aliens know the difference between a weapon and a tool.<br/><br/>Louise and Ian go up into the vessel by themselves, unaware that some of the soldiers placed a C4 bomb in there. As they try to communicate with the heptapods, Abbott starts to create a message with hundreds of tiny, scattered symbols. As the bomb is ready to detonate, Abbott drops Louise and Ian from the vessel as it explodes. Neither are seriously injured but both are unconscious. <br/><br/>Louise awakens in the base camp, having suffered a mild concussion. With a strike set to happen, she and Ian race to decode Abbott\\'s message. Ian deduces that many of the symbols for \"time\" are scattered, but he can\\'t exactly determine what it all means. Agent Halpern (Michael Stuhlbarg) then tells the others about how severe the situation is since Russia has reportedly executed one of their own in order to keep their intelligence secret.<br/><br/>Louise rushes toward the vessel, which sends down a small pod to take her up to the ship. She comes face-to-face with Costello, who tells her that Abbott is dying from the explosion. Costello emits more black symbol smoke, causing Louise to remember Hannah again. Costello then helps Louise to realize that the heptapods\\' language is meant to be their tool, or rather, a gift to the humans. By understanding their language, they are able to see into the future. It is revealed here that all of Louise\\'s memories of her daughter Hannah weren\\'t flashbacks, but flash-FORWARDS. Costello explains that they were sent to give humans their language so that they may help the aliens in 3,000 years time.<br/><br/>Eighteen months into the future, Louise and Shang will meet face-to-face, and he will express gratitude for her work and efforts, which ended up convincing him just what the alien\\'s true intentions were.

Both Meg and her mother Kate believed he solved the question of humanity\\'s existence and theorized that he was into another world. During the night, Meg\\'s younger brother Charles Wallace welcomes Mrs. Whatsit, a red-haired stranger in an extravagant white dress, into the Murry family house. Mrs. Whatsit claims that the Tesseract, a type of space-travel Alex was working on, is real and leaves soon after.

Meg is currently awaiting the arrival of her new little brother. As her mother Kate (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) walks in, Alex talks to Meg about how powerful love is.<br/><br/>Years later, Meg (now played by Storm Reid) is 13-years-old, and Alex has been gone for four years, with his disappearance having remained a mystery. Meg goes downstairs to find her younger brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe), in the kitchen. The two of them hear something on the radio about their father and him being missing.<br/><br/>At school, the other kids taunt Meg over her father\\'s disappearance, but particularly Veronica Kiley (Rowan Blanchard). During recess, Charles Wallace overhears two teachers talking about Alex being gone, with one of them suspecting him to be having an affair. Charles Wallace calls them out on it before bringing unwanted attention to Meg. Veronica makes a snide remark about \"crazy running in the family\", which prompts Meg to grab a basketball and hit Veronica in the face with it. Meg is forced to see Principal Jenkins (Andre Holland), who believes Meg has been using her father\\'s disappearance as an excuse to act out. Meg walks out of the office before Jenkins dismisses her.<br/><br/>Kate orders Meg to write an an apology to both Principal Jenkins and Veronica. Moments later, Charles Wallace opens the door to a stranger, a woman in a white dress with bright red hair named Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon). She has apparently been talking to Charles Wallace for a while and knows who his mom and sister are. Mrs. Whatsit tells Kate that her husband was right and that a tesseract is real, which leaves Kate stunned.<br/><br/>The next day, Meg and Charles Wallace are walking their dog. They meet Calvin O\\'Keefe (Levi Miller), a classmate of Meg\\'s who thought it was cool that she spiked Veronica in the face. They follow Charles Wallace as he runs into the home of a woman called Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), a wise woman and friend of Mrs. Whatsit who studies written works from every century.<br/><br/>The children return to the Murry house, where Calvin shares a meal with the family. Kate discusses what she and Alex had been trying to accomplish. We see a flashback to prior to Alex\\'s disappearance where the two of them discussed with a group of other scientists the possibility of creating a tesseract in order to travel across the universe, but everyone laughed at what Alex was saying.<br/><br/>Outside, Calvin learns that Veronica is Meg\\'s neighbor. Meg tries to get Calvin to hide because she thinks him being seen with her will damage his reputation, but Veronica has already seen them. Soon, the children are visited by Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and the oldest and wisest of the three, Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey). They tell Meg that her father is still alive and that his belief in tessering is real. The Misses declare that it is time to find Alex, and they transport the children across the universe.<br/><br/>Everyone ends up on another planet called Uriel, which is beautiful and vibrant. The inhabitants are living flower creatures that Mrs. Whatsit communicates with. At her behest, Meg shows the flower creatures a picture of her father, whom they apparently recognize. Mrs. Whatsit transforms into a giant leaf creature and takes the kids for a ride through the sky. They find themselves flying over her back until they spot a dark cloud forming in the sky. This causes Calvin to fall, and the flower creatures catch him. Mrs. Which explains that what they saw is called \"The It\" (voiced by David Oyelowo), the embodiment of darkness coming from the planet Camazotz. It is responsible for the negative energy in the universe and what is keeping Alex imprisoned. We see that The It\\'s influence spreads across Earth and is responsible for Veronica\\'s low self-esteem, other teachers being jealous of Jenkins being promoted to principal, and Calvin\\'s father being terrible to him for getting a less-than-perfect grade.<br/><br/>The Misses help the kids tesser to another planet to find the Happy Medium (Zach Galifianakis). With his help, they attempt to find a balance that will allow them to locate Alex. Meg feels she is not strong enough to do so, but the Misses help her find the strength to do so.<br/><br/>The Misses leave the children as they are tessered toward Camazotz to find Alex themselves. The three leave them with gifts, such as Mrs. Who\\'s magnifying glasses, and Mrs. Whatsit giving Meg \"her faults\". Meg and Calvin become separated from Charles Wallace as they find themselves in a forest. Soon, a powerful storm happens that creates some kind of cyclone. Meg notices that it is launching trees to a cliff-side where they need to go. She convinces Calvin to hide inside a log and wait for the right moment. Sure enough, the log is shot across the land and makes it to the cliff where the two of them find Charles Wallace.<br/><br/>The kids find themselves in a neighborhood where all the children and their mothers act in synchronization. One of the mothers tries to invite the kids inside for dinner, but they decline when they feel it could be a trap. The kids keep walking until they find themselves at a beach filled with people. They are found by a man known as Red (Michael Pena). He claims to know Alex and makes it seem like he\\'ll take the kids to find him. Red gives them food, but Charles Wallace says it tastes like sand. Red says he has passed a test, and he takes Charles Wallace with him as he reveals he is evil. Meg and Calvin chase after them until they end up in some kind of void. Charles Wallace starts acting malicious, as he is apparently possessed by the influence of The It.<br/><br/>Meg and Calvin are kept as prisoners, but Meg is able to move forward with the magnifying glasses to see some kind of invisible staircase and finally locate her father. The two of them reunite tearfully and embrace. They return to Calvin, but The It now has a greater hold over Charles Wallace and is threatening to keep them all as prisoners.<br/><br/>Meg soon finds herself within the realm of The It. It uses Charles Wallace to try and manipulate Meg into joining her. It creates a \"better\" copy of Meg, one with straight hair, no glasses, and an improved fashion sense. Meg rejects this and tries to save Charles Wallace. Utilizing her faults, she accepts what is not great about herself, but acknowledges that Charles Wallace loves her anyway in spite of all that. Meg\\'s love for him proves to be more powerful than The It\\'s hold, and it is weakened, letting Charles Wallace go.<br/><br/>The children reunite with the Misses, who congratulate them for succeeding in their mission. They are all tessered home. Veronica watches from her window and gives Meg a friendly wave. Calvin feels more confident in himself to go talk to his father and set things straight. The kids then enter the house with Alex, who reunites with Kate and kisses her. Meg looks up to the sky and says \"Thank you\".</div></div>'}\n",

It\\'s a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky.

He wanders into the small town of Absolution, where the local preacher, Meacham (Clancy Brown), treats his wound. After the stranger subdues Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano), who has been terrorizing the populace, Sheriff Taggart (Keith Carradine) recognizes him as Jake Lonergan, a wanted outlaw, and tries to arrest him. Jake nearly escapes, but a mysterious woman named Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) knocks him out.<br/><br/>Percy\\'s father, Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), a rich and influential cattleman, arrives with his men and demands that Percy be released to him. He also wants Jake, who stole Dolarhyde\\'s gold. During the standoff, alien spaceships begin attacking the town, and Percy, the sheriff, and many townsfolk are abducted. Jake shoots down one ship with a device concealed in his wrist band, ending the attack.<br/><br/>Dolarhyde, Ella, and some townsfolk form a posse to track an alien that may have ejected from the downed ship. Jake, meanwhile, travels to an abandoned cabin, and in a flashback, recalls returning there with the gold just before he and a woman, Alice, were abducted by the aliens. Jake returns to join the posse. During the night, the alien they were tracking appears and kills Meacham, who sacrifices himself to save Emmett, Taggart\\'s grandson.<br/><br/>By the next morning, most of the posse has deserted, and the others are attacked by Jake\\'s former gang. Jake, who stole the gang\\'s loot after their last heist, attempts to retake control, but fails. As he and the others flee, the aliens begin attacking again and Ella is seized. Jake jumps aboard the ship and attacks the alien pilot, causing the ship to crash, but Ella is mortally wounded.<br/><br/>Chiricahua Apaches capture the posse, blaming them for the alien attacks. As Ella\\'s body is dumped on a fire, she is fully resurrected. Ella is actually an alien who traveled to Earth to help humans resist the invaders after they destroyed her homeworld. The aliens, who have been abducting humans to perform experiments on, are also mining gold to power their machines. They are not invulnerable, however: Jake\\'s gauntlet weapon can kill them, as well as stabbing and shooting, though the creatures are far stronger and more durable than humans and have superior weapons. Ella claims Jake holds the secret to the aliens\\' whereabouts and says they must stop them before they exterminate all life on the planet. After taking Mescaline offered by the Indians, Jake recalls that Alice died in an alien experiment, but he escaped, inadvertently stealing the alien weapon. He can also remember the aliens\\' hidden location.<br/><br/>Armed with this knowledge, the group, now led by Colonel Dolarhyde, prepares to attack the aliens\\' grounded mothership. Jake returns to his old gang and persuades them to join the fight. In a sneak attack, the humans breach the spaceship, forcing the aliens into a ground battle. Jake and Ella board the ship and free the captives, but Jake is captured. Dolarhyde rescues him and both men escape the ship after killing the alien leader. As the remaining aliens are taking off in their damaged craft, Ella sacrifices herself, destroying the ship using Jake\\'s gauntlet.<br/><br/>Jake\\'s memory partially returns, and some abducted townsfolk can recall their past. Still a wanted man, Jake decides to leave; the sheriff and Dolarhyde say they will claim that he was killed. The citizens intend to rebuild the town with the expectation that the newly discovered gold mine will soon bring many new settlers.</div></div>'}\n",

General Brigham plans an attack to France expecting to defeat the Mimics and orders Major William Cage, who is an American public relation officer, to cover the invasion. However Cage does not accept the assignment and threatens General Brigham to expose the casualties. He is arrested, accused of desertion, demoted to private and assigned to fight in the invasion under the command of the tough Sergeant Farell in the Heathrow Base. Humans are slaughtered in the invasion and Cage kills a Mimic and is sprayed by his blood; in less than five minutes combat, Cage dies. Surprisingly he awakes in the Heathrow Base and relives the same day over and over after dieing. Each time, Cage tries to fix the deaths of his squad and he meets Sergeant Rita Vrataski who asks him to find her when he awakes in the base. Rita brings Cage to meet Dr. Carter who explains to him that he killed an Alpha and his blood has given the ability to reset time.

Losing battle after battle over five years, the NATO-led United Defense Forces finally win a victory at Verdun, France, utilizing new mechanized \"jacket\" combat suits. UK Special Forces soldier Sgt. Rita Vrataski (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm1289434/?ref_=ttpl\">Emily Blunt</a>) is hailed as \"The Angel of Verdun\" after killing hundreds of Mimics single-handedly. She becomes an instant icon and a recruiting boon for the human military as the united human armies prepare to use the momentum at Verdun to commit all their forces in a multi-pronged final assault on Europe. One of the talking heads on the newsreels telling Vrataski\\'s story and boosting the war effort is Major William Cage (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000129/?ref_=ttpl\">Tom Cruise</a>) of the US Army.<br/><br/>Cage awakens from a doze on a helicopter trip to London the morning before the invasion of France is set to take place. He meets with the Commander of the Western allies, General Brigham (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0322407/?ref_=ttpl\">Brendan Gleeson</a>), assuming the General wants Cage to help him boost his public image or prepare for a post-war political career. Instead, the General orders Cage to accompany the first wave of Allied troops to land in France and provide ground coverage for the media. Cage, who was a college ROTC Cadet and majoring in advertising and has no experience in combat, tries all of the tricks he can think of to avoid the order to embed with combat units and avoid deployment, ending with an effort to blackmail the General using his media skills. The General agrees that Cage won\\'t film the invasion, but orders Cage arrested. Cage attempts to escape but the guards Taser him, rendering him unconscious.<br/><br/>Cage wakes up on a pile of duffel bags in the afternoon at Heathrow Airport, which has become a huge military base and the jump-off point for the invasion of the Continent. A Sergeant kicks him and calls him \\'maggot\\' before Sergeant Farrell (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0000200/?ref_=ttpl\">Bill Paxton</a>) takes over. Sgt. Farrell has orders received from General Brigham that describe Private Cage as a deserter who has impersonated a Major. Cage is assigned to a band of odd-ball soldiers, J-Squad, who are caught gambling while playing poker by Farrell when Cage is introduced to them. Farrell forces J-Squad to eat the cards they are gambling with and then instructs them to get Cage ready to deploy with them tomorrow. Cage is immediately taken by the squad for Physical Training (PT).<br/><br/>The next day Cage is a nervous wreck. He is given a battle suit but the members of J-Squad won\\'t teach him how to use it, including how to disable his weapon\\' safe mode, because they believe he will just die quickly. As they are about to drop from aircraft onto the French coast, the back of their aircraft is struck by an enemy weapon and the squad drops prematurely. Although the operation to retake Europe was meant to be a surprise attack, the Mimics are completely prepared, and slaughter the humans. Sgt. Vrataski also lands on the beach but is killed within minutes. The surviving members of J-Squad are all killed rapidly. Still shell-shocked and about to die, Cage grabs a Claymore mine as a giant blue Mimic, an Alpha, jumps on him. The ensuing blast kills the Alpha Mimic, and just before Cage dies, the Alpha\\'s blue blood covers Cage\\'s wounds.<br/><br/>Cage immediately awakes in a panic in the same spot he was the day before, on top of the duffel bags. The same sergeant calls him a \\'maggot\\' and Farrell again takes him to J-squad. Despite his desperate attempt to explain that the Mimics will ambush the entire invasion, nobody believes him. Stuck in a time loop, he is repeatedly deployed and dies in a variety of ways, only to wake up again and again on the duffel bags. With each time loop, he becomes slightly more adept at killing Mimics and saving members of J-Squad and Vrataski, but the Mimics are too numerous and eventually kill everyone. In one loop, he survives long enough to tell Vrataski that he is stuck in a time loop. Recognizing his situation, Vrataski tells Cage to \"Find me when you wake up,\" before they are both killed again.<br/><br/>Cage awakens on the duffel bags again, but cooperates with Sgt. Farrell and J-Squad to buy himself time to find Vrataski. After several fatal attempts in the base at slipping away, Cage finally manages to get away during PT and finds Vrataski in a training bay surrounded by training drones. The special forces soldiers are all hostile towards him and Vrataski greets him rudely, but when he explains that Vrataski asked for him, she whisks him away to a weapons building bay where her acquaintance, Dr. Carter (<a class=\"ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity\" href=\"/name/nm0852965/?ref_=ttpl\">Noah Taylor</a>) works. There they go to a back room and Vrataski and Carter explain the time loop. Carter was formerly a researcher in General Brigham\\'s HQ, and devised a theory that all Mimics are just neural manifestations of one overmind \\'Omega\\' alien creature.<br/><br/>He tells Carter that the aliens posses the ability to turn time back, so each time an Alpha Mimic is killed, they cycle time backwards, enabling them to precisely anticipate the invasion forces\\' next actions. Vrataski explains she got into the loop when the blood of a large blue \\'Alpha\\' Mimic was spilled on her, just as Cage experienced. She was stuck in a time loop at Verdun, allowing her to kill hundreds of Mimics single-handedly in what became her final loop.<br/><br/>She explains that she was wounded and received a human blood transfusion, causing the alien blood to lose its effectiveness, and breaking the time loop. Vrataski tells Cage that he must repeat the loop until he is shown some piece of information that will help them succeed. She also tells him to always make sure he dies on the battlefield or in training or she\\'ll have to kill him to start over.<br/><br/>Carter created a device that could locate the Omega if it is stabbed into an Alpha Mimic but no one believed his theory and he was demoted and relegated to a mechanical repair unit. Cage tries to understand what he is saying but Vrataski says that to find the Omega they must first survive the invasion tomorrow. Through a large number of loops, she trains Cage, in some instances killing him over his protests when he is seriously injured so that he will resume the loop. Cage and Vrataski improved their combat skills and progress on the beach during the invasion, but despite their efforts, they both keep dying and Cage remains stuck in his loop. Cage becomes attracted to Vrataski and watching her die in repeated loops starts to take an emotional toll on him.<br/><br/>Cage finally experiences a vision showing the Omega hiding deep inside a dam in Germany. Vrataski and Carter believe the visions are due to Cage being exposed to an Alpha Mimic\\'s blood. They believe the Omega can manipulate time and perception. Cage and Vrataski focus their efforts on surviving the invasion beach and getting inland to Germany.<br/><br/>After multiple failures and deaths, Cage and Vrataski finally make it inland. During the repeated attempts Cage develops an attraction to Vrataski, and he slowly gathers details about Vrataski. In one loop, Vrataski tells Cage that she had a boyfriend at Verdun who she watched die three hundred times until she could no longer loop and he was dead for good. After they find a helicopter at a farmhouse, Vrataski realizes Cage is trying to coax her to stay in the farmhouse while he goes alone and confronts Omega. Cage admits they have looped to the farmhouse multiple times already, but every single time Vrataski dies, so he is trying to prevent her from dying again by going alone. Shocked and offended, she intentionally gets them killed.<br/><br/>During one loop, believing the fight is pointless, Cage decides not to meet Vrataski and instead goes to London and stops in a pub. There, Cage sees the Mimic\\'s next step in its attack: a large-scale amphibious assault on London in which Operation Downfall forces are destroyed. Cage is killed in London, and Vrataski and Cage work on a plan to get off the beach. After numerous loops, they make their way inland towards the Omega.<br/><br/>Cage eventually succeeds in making it to the German dam alone, but finds nothing and is almost captured by the Mimics before he manages to drown himself. In the next loop, Cage, Vrataski, and Carter put the pieces together and figure out the visions: Vrataski\\'s success in Verdun was all a ruse by the Omega Mimic. The Omega had let the humans win at Verdun in order to lure the humans into invading Europe, where all the human armies would be ambushed and annihilated. With no other leads, the device Carter made which got him fired is their last chance. Vrataski and Cage switch focus to getting the device, which is at Whitehall in a safe in General Brigham\\'s office. They infiltrate the Ministry of Defense and, after numerous loops, persuade Brigham to give them the transponder. Brigham relents and gives them the transponder before sending troops after them as they attempt to escape by car.<br/><br/>As they escape, Vrataski stabs the transponder into Cage\\'s leg. Cage sees the true location of the Omega: deep under the Louvre Museum in Paris. As they attempt to escape from the Allied headquarters, their car is stopped by a soldier in a mechanical jacket, and the airbag knocks out Vrataski before she can kill Cage.<br/><br/>Cage awakens strapped to a hospital gurney, under arrest. He sees that he is receiving a blood transfusion and realizes that he can no longer loop in time. Vrataski helps Cage escape, but without the ability to loop in time again and only several hours before the doomed invasion, Cage decides to recruit the misfit J-Squad to help them get to Paris. Cage\\'s now-intimate knowledge of J-Squad and Vrataski\\'s credibility convinces J-Squad to accompany them. They steal an aircraft and fly to Paris.<br/><br/>Once in the vicinity of the Louvre, the Mimics attack their aircraft. They must avoid killing the Alpha Mimic guarding the Omega, because that will cause the Omega to reset time, so all the team members are told to \"take one for the team\" - that is, to accept death - and not try to kill any Alpha Mimic in case they find themselves with one face-to-face. In the ensuing firefight half of J-Squad are killed. Cage, Vrataski, and three remaining J-Squad members decide to use the remaining engine power to slide the aircraft into the Louvre. Once inside, they plan to use grenades to destroy the Omega. The rest of J-Squad sacrifice themselves in the slide, and Cage and Vrataski make it into the museum. Once there, Vrataski tells Cage she will distract the Alpha Mimic while he attempts to drop a belt of grenades onto the Omega, which is under water deep under the Louvre. Vrataski tells him that neither one of them will survive the ordeal and kisses him, telling him that she wishes she had more time to get to know Cage better.<br/><br/>Vrataski leaves to distract the Alpha Mimic and Cage dives underwater to find the Omega. After a brief chase, the Alpha catches and kills Vrataski. The Omega senses Cage and dispatches the Alpha to kill Cage. The Alpha dives after Cage and stabs him, but before he dies, Cage pulls the grenade pins and drops the grenade belt into the Omega. The Omega explodes and dies, and all the Mimics die with it. After Cage dies, the Omega\\'s blood washes over and seeps into him, like the Alpha\\'s blood did on the first day of the loop, and his eyes open.<br/><br/>Cage wakens suddenly, confused, and finds himself on the helicopter en route to London on the morning before the invasion and his meeting with General Brigham. He disembarks and hears the celebratory pealing of bells. He watches a news conference during which the General announces that a huge mysterious energy blast was detected in Paris. The General says that the Mimics have died and the human forces will commence a huge sweep through Europe the next day. He sees J-Squad engaging in PT at the base. Cage looks for Vrataski and everyone treats him with respect due an officer. He finds Vrataski and she greets him with the same rudeness she has every time they meet in every loop. Cage smiles broadly.</div></div>'}\n",

The crew and the 5,000 passengers are all in hibernation pods for the 120-year journey. It is 30 years into the journey. The ship travels through a meteor storm, and power is diverted to the forward shields, then the ship collides with a large meteor and the power blinks, red alert screens come on in the control area, then quickly go back to normal. Something bad has happened.<br/><br/>Jim Preston (Chris Pratt), a mechanical engineer, wakes up in his pod with a cheery computer voice telling him that soon they will be arriving at Homestead II. He is told that it is normal to feel confused and weak after being in hibernation. The wristband on his arm is scanned, and the computer leads him to his cabin where he sleeps. The next day he wakes up, tries to decide what to wear when meeting fellow passengers, then makes his way to a cafeteria where he is the only one. He goes to an orientation session about life as a colonist on Homestead, but he is the only one there. The cheery computer generated instructor cannot understand his question about why no one else is there.<br/><br/>Jim goes to the Main Concourse and gets no help from the information kiosk. He finds an office where he can send a message to the Homestead Company, that he is warned will be expensive. He sends a message explaining he is the only one awake and needs help, then finds out it will be fifteen years before anyone on earth receives his message. He is on his own.<br/><br/>Jim finds manuals for all the ship equipment. He studies the manual on the hibernation pods but cannot find a way to get it started again once the person has woken up. He cannot get into the area where the crew pods are to try and wake anyone for help, and he cannot get into the command area. His wristband does not give him the proper clearance.<br/><br/>Jim finds the robot bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen) who he can talk to, but the robot is programmed to dispense bartender advice, like if you don\\'t like where you are, change things. Jim is a general class passenger with a basic cabin, and he breaks into a suite with nicer amenities.<br/><br/>A year passes as Jim makes use of the ship\\'s entertainment facilities, but without other people, he becomes more desperately lonely. He goes to an area where passengers can put on a space suit and go outside while safely tethered to the ship. Jim contemplates suicide by opening the airlock without a spacesuit, but stops himself and runs into the pod area. He trips near a pod with a lovely woman inside, Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence). He studies her passenger profile she had recorded before the ship set sail. She is a journalist and is traveling to Homestead to have an adventure and learn about why people choose to be a colonist. He reads her stories and thinks she is perfect. He wrestles with himself about waking her up, knowing that it will doom her to die on the ship, but he cannot stand the isolation after a year alone, so he manually makes her pod wake her up, hiding before she can see him. The same cheery computer program wakes up Aurora and leads her to her cabin to sleep.<br/><br/>Aurora wakes up the next day alone and wanders to the grand concourse where she meets Jim. He tells her the truth about how long he has been awake, but he doesn\\'t tell her that he woke her up. He has asked Arthur the robot bartender not to tell Aurora what he has done, and Arthur agrees. Aurora and Jim talk daily, discuss what can be tried to fix the pods.<br/><br/>Aurora swims, runs, and begins to write her story. She asks why Jim left planet Earth, and he says he likes to make things and fix things, and on Earth, things get replaced when they break and are not fixed. He wants to live in a house he builds himself. Her plan was to travel to the colony, spend a year there talking to colonists about why they left Earth, then return to Earth. Aurora is a gold class passenger and uses her status to procure more elaborate breakfast meals, than his standard clearance entitles him to.<br/><br/>After some time of getting to know each other, Jim asks Aurora on a date and she accepts. After they eat, he takes her to the spacesuit room, and there are two suits and they both get dressed and go outside. Coming back in, Aurora is excited, and they go to Jim\\'s cabin and make love. They are happy, have their routine of exercise, watching the stars, taking advantage of the ship\\'s entertainment and restaurant venues.<br/><br/>Another year passes, and it\\'s Aurora\\'s birthday, and Jim plans a special surprise, he made a ring for her. Going in the bar, Aurora tells Arthur that she and Jim have no secrets and Jim agrees, not realizing that Arthur interprets this as meaning that Jim has told Aurora that he woke her up. Jim steps into the men\\'s room, and Arthur tells Aurora what a good choice Jim made to pick her to wake up. Aurora is devastated and furious, and tells Jim to stay away from her. One night she enters his cabin while he\\'s sleeping, and assaults him with her fists. While she\\'s running, Jim uses a ship\\'s intercom to try and explain himself, but Aurora screams that Jim took her life.<br/><br/>While all of this is going on, the control room is more frequently getting alerts of system failures, more over time. Jim and Aurora have noticed small things like the cleaning robots having system failures.<br/><br/>It\\'s now two years since the meteor collision. One day Gus (Laurence Fishburne) wakes up and appears on the concourse, he is a deck crew chief and has woken up early. Hibernation Pods have never failed before, and he explains that something major is wrong. His wristband gets them into the command center, where they find that the ship\\'s automatic diagnostics have failed and they need to check every deck manually. While Gus runs tests before this can be done, there is a major gravity failure and Aurora almost drowns while in the swimming pool. Gus finds that there have been cascading failures, and the computer can make a timeline that shows the first failure was two years before. Gus determines that the first few failures caused power diversions to try and re-equalize the load, but the load became too heavy, causing more and more failures. The whole ship is in danger of becoming dead in space, which will doom the entire crew and passengers. The area first affected was in the main engine area, but they will have to do a manual inspection to tell where.<br/><br/>At this point, Gus collapses, and Jim and Aurora take him to the infirmary and put him in the medical auto diagnostic scanner. There are multiple necrosis all throughout his body and death is imminent, because of the malfunctioning hibernation pod. He puts on his uniform and prepares to die, and gives Jim and Aurora his wristband, so they can access the areas of the ship they need to go to fix things.<br/><br/>In engineering, Jim and Aurora find a hole made by a meteorite that goes thru some critical areas. When they open one door, Aurora is almost sucked out because of a hole thru the hull. She blocks it with a tablet Jim pushes to her, and Jim uses a liquid sealant to further seal to the hole. The area pressurizes, and they then learn the fusion engine exhaust has to be manually vented. The manual override won\\'t work, Jim has to get into a spacesuit and go outside to fix it. He ends up having to go into the exhaust passage to open a flap, but it won\\'t stay open, unless Jim holds it open so that the manual vent will work. Aurora, now desperate not to lose Jim, argues with him over the radio, but she pulls the lever. Jim is pushed out, his tether breaks, and there is a hole in his suit. He tells Aurora goodbye. She runs to get into a spacesuit herself and goes to look for him. She retrieves Jim by grabbing his tether, but when they get inside, he is unresponsive. She drags him to the infirmary, and the auto-doc says Jim is dead. Aurora uses Gus\\' wristband and his override code to get the machine to resuscitate Jim, and it works. He is alive, and she is relieved and overjoyed.<br/><br/>Later, things are back to normal on the ship. Jim works on the auto-doc and tells Aurora he found that using the command override he could put her back in hibernation in the infirmary, but he would be alone again. Aurora chooses to stay awake with Jim and make a life with him on the ship, together.<br/><br/>88 years later...<br/><br/>It\\'s the end of the voyage, and the captain and crew awake and come to the grand concourse to find there is a huge tree, lots of trailing vines and vegetation, birds flying, and a cabin (that might have Jim and Aurora\\'s grandchildren in it.) Aurora\\'s voice-over is reading her story to the passengers, explaining how they made a good life where they were.</div></div>'}\n",

While longing for a family of his own, Lewis has grown saddened over the years as all his attempts to be adopted seem to have failed. As well, each and every invention he attempts to fashion meets with disaster.<br/><br/>One day, Lewis\\' thinking turns to his Mother, and why she chose to leave him on the orphanage\\'s doorstep all those years ago. This leads Lewis to think that maybe deep within his mind, a memory of her still exists, and maybe with it, he can find his Mom and reunite with her.<br/><br/>Lewis then tinkers non-stop on a machine to unearth the memory deep in his mind. Unrealized to Lewis, the constant tinkering sleep-deprives his roommate, Mike Yagoobian (also known as \\'Goob\\'). however, Lewis is too busy with his own work to realize the effect on the other boy.<br/><br/>While Goob goes to play on the school baseball team, Lewis takes his invention to the science fair. During the science fair, he runs into a strange boy named Wilbur Robinson, who cautions him to stay away from \\'The Bowler-Hat Guy.\\' Lewis ignores this, and attempts to make his invention work. Unknown to him, the \\'Bowler-Hat Guy\\' and his hat (a mechanical creation) sabotage the item, causing it to malfunction, sending Lewis sadly running back to the orphanage.<br/><br/>Once there, he encounters Wilbur again, who tosses Lewis into a strange machine, that then appears to take them into the future. Wilbur is amazed, and attempts to use the time machine to go back in time and find his Mother. However, the two boys end up crashing the time machine, which Wilbur took from his Father\\'s lab without permission.<br/><br/>While trying to figure out what to do, Wilbur takes Lewis to the Robinson mansion, where the boy is introduced to the strange yet caring family, albeit always wearing some strange form of headgear (a fruitbasket, a hat, etc)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, \\'Bowler Hat Guy,\\' and his mechanical hat, take Lewis\\' invention, and attempt to sell it to a local company. However, \\'Bowler Hat Guy\\' has no idea how it works, and the hat (whom he calls Doris), decides they need to find Lewis to figure it out.<br/><br/>Going back to the orphanage, \\'Bowler Hat Guy\\' encounters Goob, who due to sleep deprivation, lost the game, and suffered the wrath of his teammates. Goob explains that the orphanage\\'s supervisor said he should move on, but \\'Bowler Hat Guy\\' states that Goob should use that experience, and never forget it...much to Goob\\'s confusion.<br/><br/>After searching more of the Orphanage, Doris calculates that Lewis must have went to the future with Wilbur Robinson, and the two head into the future with a time machine of their own.<br/><br/>Back in the future, Lewis is introduced to more of the Robinsons\\' house, and how Lewis\\' father, Cornelius, is a great inventor, having successfully perfected time travel. However, Cornelius\\' most recent time iteration was stolen by the \\'Bowler Hat Guy,\\' and this explains why Wilbur is trying desperately to set things right.<br/><br/>At the same time, Doris infiltrates the house, and attempts to kill Wilbur, but not before finding that \\'Bowler Hat Guy\\' has time-travelled back and forth through time, returning to the future with a Tyrannosaurus Rex.<br/><br/>The Robinson family and Lewis manage to take down the enormous beast, and the family is ecstatic. It is then that Wilbur lets slip that Lewis is an orphan, and the family unanimously approves...until Wilbur knocks the hat off, prompting Wilbur\\'s mother, Franny, to declare that Lewis has to go back to his own time.<br/><br/>Hurt and upset that he has once again seemingly lost the chance to have a family of his own, Lewis walks away, but is then accosted by \\'Bowler Hat Guy\\' and Doris, who promise that if he helps fix his machine, they\\'ll take him back in time to find his Mom.<br/><br/>Taking Lewis to the orphanage (now an abandoned building), Lewis fixes the memory-scanning machine, but \\'Bowler Hat Guy\\' has Doris tie Lewis up, going back on his promise.<br/><br/>It is then that \\'Bowler Hat Guy\\' reveals that he is actually Mike Yagoobian. Goob explains how Lewis\\' tinkering kept him from sleeping properly, and resulted in him losing the baseball game at school. Goob channelled this into deep resentment towards Lewis, that ate away at him, and caused his bad mood to keep him from ever getting adopted. in that time, Lewis was adopted, and many years later, became known as Cornelius Robinson, the head of Robinson Industries.<br/><br/>Goob angrily tried to get revenge on Lewis, but his weak attempts proved worthless. It wasn\\'t until meeting Doris, the robotic bowler hat (a rejected experiment of Lewis\\') came up with a plan of her own.<br/><br/>Lewis tries to get Goob to see that he (Goob) also shares some of the blame, since Goob was not able to move on from that baseball game loss, but Goob refuses to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Wilbur and Carl make it back to the orphanage rooftop and rescue Louis, but Doris stabs Carl through the chest and steals the memory scanner. Wilbur is soon wiped from existence.<br/><br/>Goob and Doris return to the local company visited earlier and successfully present not only Lewis\\'s memory scanner but also Doris, who is passed off as a helping hat. After the presentation, Goob realised that Doris had bigger plans to take over the world, whereas Goob only wanted to mess up Lewis\\'s future instead of enslaving mankind.<br/><br/>Lewis goes back to see the rest of his family to come, but they\\'re all controlled by Doris hats. He repairs the time machine and goes outside, seeing the future turned into an apocalyptic wasteland.<br/><br/>He goes back and interrupts Goob\\'s presentation, stating Doris\\'s true plans. Lewis then says that he will never invent Doris, leading her to be wiped from existence.<br/><br/>Lewis and Goob go back to the future, where the apocalyptic wasteland turns into a bright future with Robinson Industries being restored. Wilbur comes back into existence, thanking Lewis for fixing everything.<br/><br/>Soon, Lewis meets Cornelius and the latter shows him his lab, with the memory scanner. Lewis soon goes back to the present and wakes up Goob, leading his team to win and stopping him from becoming a bitter man. He then goes back to the Science Fair and tests his memory scanner on Dr. Krunklehorn, who turns out to be a younger Lucille. He also meets a younger Bud, who adopts Lewis and takes him to a new house that turns out to be Robinson Industries.</div></div>'}\n",

Even though Gadget is assigned to the Police, Quimby still dislikes the idea of a machine being shoehorned into his department, and relegates Gadget to community projects...like rescuing cats from trees.<br/><br/>After the announcement, a gala celebration is held, wherein Gadget accompanies Brenda to the festivities. At the event, Scolex appears, and offers Brenda her own facilities and funding. Though Gadget reminds her of her and her Father\\'s work on the \\'Gadget Program,\\' Brenda gladly accepts Scolex\\'s offer, unaware of his plans to steal her technological ideas and designs.<br/><br/>Gadget is also upset that he is not being taken seriously, and sets out to find out who killed Brenda\\'s father, with the help of his niece Penny, and her dog Brain. A mechanical piece at the scene of the crime contains the initials \\'SI,\\' leading Gadget to Scolex Industries.<br/><br/>In the meantime, with Brenda working for him, Scolex has stolen several of her ideas, and crafted two robotic clones of his own: one a bimbo-like clone of Brenda, and another that is an evil clone of Inspector Gadget. While Scolex keeps Brenda\\'s clone for himself, Robo-Gadget is sent out to terrorize the public.<br/><br/>Gadget manages to break into Scolex\\'s facility, but is captured when he tries to recover the robotic foot stolen from Brenda\\'s lab. Gadget is then eliminated when Scolex has the \\'Gadget Chip\\' destroyed, leaving his assistant Sikes to dump Gadget at the City Dump.<br/><br/>In the aftermath, Robo-Gadget goes on a mad rampage, prompting Brenda and Penny to try and find the real Gadget. Using the Gadgetmobile, they find him in the dump, but without the chip. However, due to Gadget\\'s caring and emotions, he manages to start back up, and everyone decides to go after Scolex.<br/><br/>After dropping off Penny and Brain at home, Brenda and Gadget find Scolex\\'s limo, containing both Scolex and Robo-Gadget. Gadget wrestles Robo-Gadget into the streets, and the two have a battle until Gadget finally wins.<br/><br/>Gadget activiates his Gadgetcopter, and heads to Scolex\\'s building, in time to see him flying away with Brenda. Gadget manages to disable the helicopter, and safely recovers Brenda.<br/><br/>In the aftermath, Scolex and his assistant Sikes are arrested for the murder of Brenda\\'s father, and as the Police arrive, Quimby acknowledges Gadget as an actual member of the police force.<br/><br/>As Scolex is led away, he vows to get Gadget \\'next time,\\' as the Inspector and Brenda head off.</div></div>'}\n",

Astoundingly, David is not only alive, he hardly seems to have been touched. As David wonders what has happened to him and why he was able to walk away, he encounters a mysterious stranger, Elijah Prince (Samuel L. Jackson), who explains to David that there are a certain number of people who are \"unbreakable\" -- they have remarkable endurance and courage, a predisposition toward dangerous behavior, and feel invincible but also have strange premonitions of terrible events. Is David \"unbreakable\"? And if he is, what are the physical and psychological ramifications of this knowledge?</div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">Engulfed in perpetual sadness, David Dunn--a former football player and now a security guard with an unsuccessful marriage--emerges unscathed from a devastating train crash that claimed the lives of 131 passengers. Before long, Dunn\\'s polar opposite--the brittle-boned comic-book art dealer, Elijah Price--approaches the tragedy\\'s sole survivor, utterly convinced that luck had nothing to do with his miraculous survival; moreover, the mysterious stranger has a preposterous theory which explains the condition of the man whose bones never break. However, do life\\'s antitheses define one\\'s destiny? Above all--if there\\'s a connection between Price and Dunn--is David, indeed, \"unbreakable\"?<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=Nick%20Riganas&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_3\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Nick Riganas</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">Security Guard David Dunn miraculously survives a catastrophic train crash outside Philadelphia. Not only is he the sole survivor out of 132 passengers, he also is completely unharmed. A little later, comic book specialist Elijah Price contacts him to confront David with an incredible theory: Elijah, who has been nicknamed \"Mr. Glass\" due to his more than fragile bones, thinks that David has got all which he himself lacks. The two of them \"seem to be linked by a curve, but sitting on opposite ends\". First, David does not believe the strange man, but every single thing he had said proves to be true: David has never ever been hurt or sick in his life, his physical strength is larger than normal and he has a skill which others don\\'t. Slowly, David begins to discover the shocking truth behind Mr. Price\\'s assumptions. But after all, David\\'s fate is not only to find his real place in the world. It also is about proving Elijah\\'s theory of his own existence.<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=Julian%20Reischl%20%3Cjulianreischl%40mac.com%3E&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_4\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Julian Reischl &lt;julianreischl@mac.com&gt;</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">David Dunn\\'s marriage is crumbling, and he\\'s thinking of moving to New York. Then when he\\'s coming home from a job interview, his train derails and he is the only survivor. More than that, he doesn\\'t have a scratch on him. David is contacted by Elijah Price, who runs a comic book art gallery and suffers from a genetic condition that makes his bones very easy to break. Elijah has been a comic book fan all his life, and has developed a theory that they are what remains of an ancient system of storytelling, and the superheroes they are about are based on real people. Elijah believes David may be one of these people. He has hardly ever been injured or sick, and he has tremendous strength, plus an uncanny ability to tell if someone is about to or has done something bad. David doesn\\'t know what to think about the theory, or Elijah himself. However, events soon conspire to convince him he may be a superhero after all.<span data-reactroot=\"\" style=\"display:block\">—<a aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"ipc-link ipc-link--base\" href=\"/search/title/?plot_author=rmlohner&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha&amp;ref_=ttpl_pl_5\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">rmlohner</a></span></div></div> <div class=\"ipc-html-content ipc-html-content--base\" role=\"presentation\"><div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\">The film opens as we see a baby being born in west Philadelphia. This is Elijah Price. Elijah is so brittle that he is born with broken arms and legs. As he grows older, he is taunted at school and called \"Mr. Glass\" by his classmates since he is so fragile. As an adult, he runs a successful high priced comic book art gallery specializing in original drawings of superheroes.<br/><br/>David Dunn is a security guard at the local college stadium. His marriage is crumbling and in fact, his wife, Audrey Dunn, sleeps downstairs in their son\\'s room, and David sleeps upstairs with his son.<br/><br/>On his way back home from a job interview in New York, David\\'s train malfunctions and derails, killing everyone on board except David. He doesn\\'t even have a scratch. After the memorial service for the crash victims, David finds a note on his windshield. It\\'s from a store named \"Limited Edition\" (Elijah\\'s store) and the note asks, \"How many days of your life have you been sick?\"<br/><br/>David asks his boss and his wife, but no one can ever remember him being sick. David takes his son to \"Limited Edition\" where he meets Elijah.<br/><br/>Elijah explains his theory to David...\\nIf Elijah can be born with brittle bones and very easily hurt, shouldn\\'t there be someone the exact opposite? Elijah has researched every disaster to find a sole survivor without a scratch but has had no luck. After years of searching, he finally has found one in David Dunn.<br/><br/>David thinks it\\'s interesting but really just thinks Elijah is nuts. Back at the stadium, David gets a call that there is someone there trying to sneak in and asking for David. It\\'s Elijah and he starts explaining his comic book theories to David. Theories about everyday men being superheroes, having powers they haven\\'t yet realized and so on. David bumps into a guy in line and tells the security at the end of the line to start frisking people. They watch as the guy David bumped in to, sees everyone being frisked and leaves the line. Elijah asks David what that was all about, and David tells him that when he bumped him, he had an image of a certain kind of handgun.<br/><br/>David goes back to work but Elijah follows the guy David bumped into. They go down a long flight of stairs, Elijah falls shattering his leg and breaking several other bones but the last thing he sees is the man\\'s handgun, just as David described it. Elijah was right, David does have some kind of special gift.<br/><br/>Back at home, David is working out in the basement with his weight set. His son believed everything Elijah said about David being a hero with a special gift. David still doesn\\'t believe. David asks his son to take some weight off but without him knowing, he puts more weight on. David lifts 250 pounds, the most he\\'s ever done. His son continues putting on more weight until David is now up to 350 pounds. He has had all this strength all along that he never knew.<br/><br/>Elijah needs his leg rehabbed and his nurse is Audrey, David\\'s wife. Elijah asks her questions about her and David and she explains to him how when they were going out, David was a star football player but got in a car accident due to icy roads. David never played football again. It was because of that, that she and David were married. Had he continued to play, she knows they would have grown apart.<br/><br/>Back at work, David gets a call from his son\\'s school that his son has been hurt. His son had hoped that some of David\\'s superhero traits had rubbed off on him. He tried to protect someone that was being picked on and instead got hurt in the process. The school nurse remembers David from when he was at that same school. In fact, it was because of David that they have strict rules about the pool. It seems that David had been picked on near the pool when he was a student there. He fell in and was left in the pool to drown. He was found at the bottom of the pool but somehow survived.<br/><br/>David tells this story to Elijah, that in fact, David can get hurt. Elijah tells him that every superhero has a weakness. David\\'s kryptonite is water. The water from the pool and the water from the icy roads.<br/><br/>David\\'s wife decides that him surviving the train crash is a sign that maybe they should give their marriage another try. They go out on a \"date\", and he explains to her that he felt their marriage was over when he stopped waking her up after he had a bad dream.<br/><br/>The next night, David breaks into the train station and examines some of the wrecked trains. He starts recalling his own car crash from years earlier and remembers that he wasn\\'t hurt at all. In fact, he had to use his superhuman strength to rescue Audrey from the flaming vehicle.<br/><br/>He goes to Elijah and tells him he is right; he has never been sick or injured in any way. Elijah tells him that it\\'s no coincidence that David is in the security field. He needs to go to where people are and protect them.<br/><br/>It\\'s a rainy day and David, wearing a hooded rain poncho heads to Penn station. Hundreds of people are passing by. Whenever someone bumps into David, he has a vision of that person doing something evil. One is a jewel thief, another a rapist, but when the maintenance man bumps into him, David gets a horrible vision. The vision is of the man going to someone\\'s home and killing the homeowner.<br/><br/>David, still wearing the poncho now looking more and more like a superhero\\'s cape, follows the guy as he leaves work. The guy goes to a nice house in a nice neighborhood. David sneaks in the back and finds the dead homeowner inside. He goes upstairs and rescues two sisters tied up in their bathroom. He goes into another room and finds the mother tied up. The window is open, and David looks out. When he turns back around, there is the maintenance worker who pushes David out the window. David lands on the backyard pool that has its winter cover on. Suddenly, the cover starts collapsing with David\\'s weight and he gets all tangled up underwater with the cover. He is drowning again but the two sisters force a pole down to him and David grabs it and is saved.<br/><br/>David heads back upstairs and wrestles with the guy and finally kills him by breaking his neck.<br/><br/>The next scene is David back at home, hanging up his cape, er um.. poncho, and carrying his sleeping wife upstairs to their bed. She wakes up and asks him what is wrong. \"I had a bad dream\" he says.<br/><br/>In the morning while having breakfast, David slides the newspaper over to his son and holds a finger to his mouth to shush him. The headline tells of a mystery hero that saved the two girls. The picture is an artist\\'s rendition of what the girls saw. It shows a superhero-like figure with a hood and cape. The boy looks up at his dad and David just smiles and nods.<br/><br/>David goes to Elijah\\'s gallery where Elijah is having a huge gathering for a special show. He and David go to Elijah\\'s back office so they can discuss what had happened. Elijah has been in a wheelchair since his fall. He is really proud of David and they shake hands.<br/><br/>Suddenly...<br/><br/>Just like Christopher Walken in Stephen King\\'s \"The Dead Zone\", while shaking hands, David has a vision of Elijah setting a building on fire, another vision of Elijah causing a plane crash and finally, a vision of Elijah exiting the driving compartment of David\\'s train that crashed. David looks around Elijah\\'s office and is horrified at what he sees. Newspaper clippings of hundreds of disasters from around the world. Elijah is the mastermind behind all these events and has staged them for his own selfish benefit.<br/><br/>Just like in the comics, every evil villain needs a worthy adversary and Elijah has finally found his.<br/><br/>David backs away in horror as Elijah, who in his wheelchair now looks more like Professor X of the X-men, proclaims...<br/><br/>\"They call me Mr. Glass!\"<br/><br/>Just before the final credits, a message appears that says that David contacted the authorities and Elijah is now in an institution for the criminally insane.</div></div>'}\n"
